  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Niemann-Pick Disease, Type C (NPC) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder with a wide clinical
      spectrum and variable age of onset. Classically, children with NPC demonstrate neurological
      dysfunction with cerebellar ataxia (an inability to coordinate balance, gait, extremity and
      eye movements), dysarthria (difficulty speaking), seizures, vertical gaze palsy (ability to
      move eyes in the same direction) motor impairment, dysphagia (trouble swallowing), psychotic
      episodes, and progressive dementia. There is no curative treatment for NPC and it is a
      lethal disorder. The purpose of this protocol is to obtain both baseline and rate of
      progression data on a clinical and biochemical markers that may later be used as outcome
      measures in a clinical trial. Specifically, this study will examine and characterize the
      longitudinal progression of neurocognitive symptoms of NPC with the goal of identifying
      early markers of disease progression that may be utilized in later trials to evaluate
      treatment efficacy.

    <description>The composite score of neurocognitive measures will be calculated as follows: raw scores of neurocognitive tests will be transformed to Z-scores on normative data to allow comparison across measures administered at different ages. A score will be generated for each of the following domains: Intellectual Ability,Visual-Spatial Skills, Rote Verbal Memory, Narrative Verbal Memory, Visual-Spatial Construction, Nonverbal Working Memory, Language, Fine Motor, Attention, Executive Functioning, and Adaptive Behavior. Behavioral and emotional difficulties will be rated in terms of presence or absence of symptoms above a clinical cutoff score.</description>

        Longitudinal observational study of cognition in patients with NPC. Subjects will be
        recruited from participants in an observational study currently in progress at NIH, and
        from subjects receiving clinical care at Mayo Clinic. Participants will be administered
        age-and functionally-appropriate neuropsychological test instruments annually to track
        cognitive changes over time, and to link these data to the subjects' scores on the NIH
        disability scale.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All individuals between the ages of 2 years and 99 with an established diagnosis of
        Niemann-Pick Disease, Type C (biochemical or molecular) will be considered for this study.
        Patients with both Niemann-Pick Disease, Type C1 (NPC1) and Niemann-Pick Disease, Type C2
        (NPC2) mutations are eligible to participate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Participants with at least one of the following will not be eligible for this study:

          1. Individuals that cannot travel because of their medical condition or are too ill to
             be cared for at home,

          2. Individuals with stage 4 disease (non-ambulant with vegetative disturbances)

          3. Individuals will be excluded if English is not their primary language

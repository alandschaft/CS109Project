        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Diagnosed with epilepsy and expected to have at least one motor seizure in the EMU

          -  Determined by the Investigator to be an acceptable candidate for epilepsy evaluation
             with intracranial or scalp electrode monitoring

          -  Willing and able to wear 3 ActiGraph GT3X+ devices for the duration of their
             participation in the study and comply with the study protocol

          -  Have one of the following seizure types: (a) partial seizures with secondary
             generalization, which results in visible clonic or tonic-clonic motor behavior; (b)
             primarily generalized seizures (in patients with either primary [idiopathic] or
             secondary [symptomatic] generalized epilepsy), which may involve the following
             depending on the motor manifestation observed: myoclonic seizures, clonic seizures,
             tonic-clonic seizures, or atonic seizures.

          -  Be able to consent to participate by signing the Informed Consent document after a
             full explanation of the nature and purpose of this study

          -  Male or non-pregnant female

          -  English speaking

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently enrolled in another investigational device, drug, or surgery study.
             Concurrent physiologic study participation is acceptable

          -  Have an implanted device that may interfere with GT3X+ recordings, ECoG/EEG
             recordings, ECG recordings, or video recordings

          -  Have a movement disorder that may affect GT3X+ recordings

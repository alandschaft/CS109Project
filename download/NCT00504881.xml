        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects were aged from 16 to 70 years, inclusive. Subjects under 18 years of age
             were only included where legally permitted and ethically accepted

          -  Subjects had well-characterized localization-related Epilepsy or generalized Epilepsy
             according to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification

          -  For subjects suffering from localization-related Epilepsy: subjects had at least 2
             Partial-Onset Seizures (POSs) whether or not secondarily generalized per month during
             the 3 months preceding Visit 1 according to the ILAE classification

          -  For subjects suffering from localization-related Epilepsy: subjects had at least 4
             Partial-Onset Seizures (POSs) whether or not secondarily generalized during the
             4-week Baseline Period according to the ILAE classification

          -  For subjects suffering from generalized Epilepsy: subjects had at least 2 Type
             II-seizure days per month during the 3 months preceding Visit 1 according to the ILAE
             classification

          -  For subjects suffering from generalized Epilepsy: subjects had at least 4 Type
             II-seizure days during the 4 week Baseline Period according to the ILAE
             classification

          -  Subjects were uncontrolled while treated by 1 to 3 permitted concomitant
             Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs). Vagal nerve stimulation was allowed and was not counted
             as a concomitant AED

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For subjects who suffered from localization-related Epilepsy: history or presence of
             Seizures occurring only in clusters (too frequently or indistinctly separated to be
             reliably counted) before Visit 2 or occurring only as Type IA non-motor

          -  Subjects with a history or presence of Status Epilepticus during the year preceding
             Visit 1 or during Baseline

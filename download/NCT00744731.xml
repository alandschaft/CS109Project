    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain long-term safety and tolerability information on
      carisbamate as add-on therapy for the treatment of partial onset seizures in patients with
      epilepsy. Seizure counts will be obtained to measure the rate of seizures for each patient
      during the study.

    <textblock>
      CARISEPY3014 is the open-label extension study that follows the double-blind study
      CARISEPY3013 (NCT00740623). In an open label study such as CARISEPY3014, both the physician
      and the patient know the name of the assigned study medication. In a double blind study such
      as CARISEPY-3013, neither the physician nor the patient knows the name of the assigned study
      medication. Patients who complete the 14-week double-blind treatment phase of study
      CARISEPY3013 will be eligible to enter the open-label extension study during which patients
      will transition through a 1-week blinded period to open-label carisbamate. There will be a 1
      week blinded transition during which patients will take blinded study medication; after
      this, patients will then take unblinded, open-label study medication. Safety assessments
      include the monitoring of the frequency, severity, and timing of adverse events, clinical
      laboratory test results, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, vital signs
      measurements, physical and neurologic examinations, the Physician Withdrawal Checklist for
      symptoms of withdrawal for those patients who taper and/or discontinue study drug, and
      pregnancy tests for females of childbearing potential. Seizure counts will be obtained at
      every visit. The Quality of Life in Epilepsy-31 Patient Inventory questionnaire will be
      administered once during the study. A Medical Resource utilization questionnaire will be
      used to obtain cost-effectiveness information on carisbamate and will be administered twice
      during the study. There is no statistical testing hypothesis for this study. Carisbamate
      tablets taken twice daily in 2 equally divided doses, with or without food, and taken with
      noncarbonated water. During the first week on study, patients will take blinded transition
      study medication and thereafter will take a target dosage of 800 mg/day of unblinded,
      open-label study medication. The dosage of study medication will range from 400 to 1,200
      mg/day. Patients will receive treatment for 1 year with the potential to receive treatment
      longer.

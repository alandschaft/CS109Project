  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, trial designed to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety,
      tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of 3 multiple ascending doses of Cannabidiol Oral
      Solution in a sequential fashion.

      Participants will be pediatric (aged 1-17, inclusive), experiencing treatment-resistant
      seizures, and satisfy all inclusion/exclusion criteria.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Meets protocol-specified criteria for qualification and contraception, including
             treatment-resistant seizure disorder

          -  Is able to speak and understand the language in which the study is being conducted,
             is able to understand the procedures and study requirements and has voluntarily
             signed and dated an informed consent form approved by the Institutional Review Board
             before the conduct of any study procedure

          -  In the opinion of the Investigator, the participants and parent(s)/caregiver(s) are
             willing and able to comply with the study procedures and visit schedules, including
             venipuncture, inpatient stay at the study center, dosing at the study center twice a
             day as needed while an outpatient), and the Follow-up Visits (if applicable)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject or parent(s)/caregiver(s) have daily commitments during the study duration
             that would interfere with attending all study visits

          -  History or current use of dietary supplements, drugs or over-the counter medications
             outside protocol-specified parameters

          -  Signs, symptoms or history of any condition that, per protocol or in the opinion of
             the investigator, might compromise:

               1. the safety or well-being of the participant or study staff

               2. the safety or well-being of the participant's offspring (such as through
                  pregnancy or breast-feeding)

               3. the analysis of results

    <textblock>
      This a phase 2 study comparing the efficacy of intravenous (IV) lacosamide (LCM) with IV
      fosphenytoin (fPHT) in controlling frequent nonconvulsive seizures (NCSs), the Adverse
      Events profile of LCM compared with fPHT when used to treat frequent NCSs, and length of
      stay in an intensive care unit for subjects treated with LCM versus subjects treated with
      fPHT. The trial will include a preacute-treatment period, an acute-treatment period, a
      postacute-treatment period, and a long-term follow-up period.

    <description>fPHT treatment arm, a bolus of 20 mg PE/kg will be administered at a rate of no greater than 75 mg PE/minute. If a further bolus is required, 5 mg PE/kg will be administered. The daily maintenance dose for fPHT will be 5 mg PE/kg divided into 2 doses.</description>

    <description>LCM treatment arm, a bolus of 400 mg will be administered over 30 minutes. If a further bolus is required, 200 mg will be administered. Regardless of whether the subject received a rebolus, he or she will begin receiving a maintenance dose 12 hours after the initial dose. The daily maintenance dose will be the same as the total bolus (400 mg or 600 mg) divided into 2 doses.</description>

    <description>If any of the following occurs, the subject will have reached the end of the first treatment arm and will &quot;cross over&quot; and begin receiving the other drug, ie, the one not originally administered:
The subject subsequently has another seizure within 24 hours following the 2-hour post-rebolus observation-only period.
The subject does not receive a rebolus but has a seizure within 24 hours following the 2 hour post-bolus observation-only period.
The subject experiences an AE that precludes further use of the first study drug.
If crossover occurs, the subject will &quot;start over&quot; with the second drug, going through the same observation-only period, rebolusing (if necessary), and study assessments with the second drug, beginning with the Baseline assessments.</description>

          3. Are experiencing NCSs according to the following criteria:

               -  At least 1 ESz lasting at least 10 seconds, with or without clinical correlates,

               -  If individual ESzs are not well defined, ESz time is at least 10 seconds and
                  less than 30 minutes per hour of cEEG recording.

          4. Are being considered for treatment with an IV AED.

          5. Are at least 18 years old.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Treatment with PHT, fPHT, or LCM in the last 7 days.

          3. Ongoing generalized convulsive status epilepticus (SE) (more than 2 generalized
             tonic-clonic seizures within 30 minutes without recovery to baseline or 1 seizure
             lasting longer than 10 minutes).

          4. Episodes of SE, defined as at least 30 minutes of ESz activity in 1 hour, in the last
             6 hours.

          5. Encephalopathic event secondary to acute anoxic/hypoxic event.

          6. Undergoing therapeutic hypothermia protocol.

          7. Continuous EEG monitoring showing only periodic discharges or rhythmic delta activity
             without clear ESzs (for definitions of periodic discharges, rhythmic delta activity,
             and ESzs, see the Manual of Operations).

          8. Electroencephalographic seizures consistent with typical absence seizures.

          9. Evaluation for spell characterization or surgical treatment for epilepsy.

         10. Pregnancy.

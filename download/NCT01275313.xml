  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical trial is aimed at demonstrating the important role wheelchairs play in
      preventing pressure ulcers (bed sores). Although most pressure ulcers can be prevented, they
      are common in nursing home settings because their causes are difficult to identify. This
      clinical trial will guide practitioners toward improving preventive care practices by
      demonstrating how to effectively apply wheelchair and seat cushion technology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pressure ulcers are a significant healthcare problem for the growing number of nursing home
      residents in the United States and around the world. Pressure ulcers diminish quality of
      life, exact a devastating loss of function, increase the risk of death in geriatric
      populations and raise healthcare costs. Costs for the management of pressure ulcers in the
      US likely exceeds $6.4 billion annually, with a prevalence of approximately 12% in the high
      risk LTC population. A previous clinical trial at the University of Pittsburgh studied the
      effects of seat cushions on pressure ulcer incidence and found that when a skin protection
      seat cushion is used with a properly fitted wheelchair there is a significant reduction in
      incidence. The data led the investigators to question whether having a properly fitted
      wheelchair also has a significant effect on pressure ulcer incidence. This clinical trial
      investigate this question by randomizing subjects into a control group that receives a skin
      protection cushion and wheelchair training for use in their facility supplied wheelchair, or
      a treatment group that receives a skin protection cushion, wheelchair training and a new
      custom-fitted wheelchair. We expect that the treatment group will have a lower incidence of
      pressure ulcers.

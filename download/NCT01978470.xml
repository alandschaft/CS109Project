      This study evaluates the safety and tolerability of the NeuroSigma eTNS system for the
      treatment of drug resistent partial seizures.

      Up to 20 subjects, ages 18 - 75, with partial epilepsy will be enrolled in an acute 4-week
      tolerability study at Olive View/UCLA Medical Center .......

      Enrolled subjects will be asked to maintain an accurate seizure calendar, and will be seen
      at the initial visit, then at two and four weeks.......

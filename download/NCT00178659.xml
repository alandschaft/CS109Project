      The specific aim of this research is to determine if the blood from brain-injured patients
      contains reproducible protein markers that appear prior to elevations in intracranial
      pressure (ICP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the major causes of death following brain trauma is increased intracranial pressure
      (ICP). Currently, there are no effective ways to predict if the ICP of a patient will reach
      uncontrollable levels. Various cytokines (balance between pro-and anti-inflammatory) and
      other factors are thought to underlie increases in ICP. The specific aim of this research is
      to determine if the blood from brain-injured patients contains reproducible protein markers
      that appear prior to elevations in ICP. We propose to employ mass spectrometry, antibody
      array and ELISA to profile proteins in the serum of patients suffering from traumatic brain
      injury. These protein profiles will be compiled by a pattern recognition program that has
      the capacity to learn and make predictions based on the spectra and associated patient
      information. Each time a sample is analyzed, it is added to the database allowing the
      program to make increasingly accurate predictions. Protein profiles of patients with known
      ICP values will be analyzed. Our hypothesis is that alterations in serum protein composition
      will precede changes in intracranial pressure giving rise to predictable patterns that can
      be detected using large-scale proteomic analysis. After approximately 90 non-brain trauma
      and 90 brain-trauma patients are analyzed, if markers are found, the predictability of
      elevated ICP will be tested. If successful, this may aid the neurosurgeon in determining
      future courses of treatment.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current practice guidelines for patients with acute low back pain (LBP) recommend a stepped
      care approach with initial treatment of education and advice to remain active. Referral to
      physical therapy is considered only when patients fail to recover after a few weeks. Recent
      research has led to the identification a subgroup of patients likely to experience rapid,
      pronounced, and sustained decreases in disability and pain with a brief manipulation and
      exercise intervention, suggesting it may be more cost-effective to manage this sub-group
      with early referral to physical therapy instead of the usual care approach. The integration
      of this evidence into routine practice has not been evaluated. We will assess the outcomes
      of integrating this evidence into the management of patients with low back pain. The study
      is a randomized trial, comparing management with early manipulation with the current care
      process model. Patients fitting the inclusion criteria will be randomized into one of two
      groups. One group will be managed with the current care process model. The other group will
      be managed consistent with the decision rule recommending early referral for a brief
      manipulation and exercise intervention during the first 4 weeks. Patients will be followed
      over 1 year. Outcomes will include measures of disability, pain, satisfaction, and direct
      medical costs. The study will examine the costs and effectiveness of integrating the
      alternative care model into practice.

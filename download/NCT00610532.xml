      The study is being done to understand why some patients with epilepsy (disease of recurrence
      of seizures) do not respond very well to drug treatment with anticonvulsants.

      Despite the availability of many anticonvulsants, about 30% of patients with epilepsy are
      resistant to them. The cause of the resistance is not clear, but one of the reasons could be
      an increased amount of proteins in the cells of the body called transporter proteins.

      Transporter proteins are a group of proteins that help to defend the body against toxins,
      including drugs, by pumping them out of the cells. Studies have shown that the number of
      transporter proteins is higher in the parts of the brain that trigger seizures when compared
      to other parts of the brain.

      Studies in animals have shown that taking an anticonvulsant with an inhibitor (meaning &quot;to
      stop&quot; or &quot;to reduce&quot;) of a transporter protein can increase the concentration of that
      anticonvulsant inside the brain cells. The main purpose of the study is to determine if
      taking an anticonvulsant and a transporter protein inhibitor will change the brain
      concentration of the anticonvulsant.

      In this study, a single dose of phenytoin (DilantinÂ® is a brand name anticonvulsant which
      has phenytoin as its active ingredient), a commonly used anticonvulsant, will be given once
      by itself, and then will be given a separate time with a single (i.e. one time only) dose of
      probenecid. Probenecid, a medicine used commonly to treat gout (a disease of increased uric
      acid), is known to be an inhibitor of transporter proteins. The study will use
      electroencephalogram or EEG (recording of brain wave activities) to determine if the EEG
      pattern when probenecid is given, will be different from the EEG pattern when phenytoin is
      given alone. This will suggest that probenecid has affected the brain concentration of
      phenytoin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 30% of patients with epilepsy are refractory to medical treatment (pharmacoresistant
      epilepsy). The cause of which is multifactorial. Multidrug resistance (MDR) causes decreased
      uptake of medicines in tissues. MDR occurs because of overexpression of a family of
      transporter proteins that act as a physiological defense mechanism that pumps toxins out of
      cells. Two groups of transporters, P-glycoprotein (PGP) and multidrug resistance-associated
      proteins (MRP), are important gatekeepers in the blood brain barrier. PGP and MRP are
      overexpressed in the brain tissue of pharmacoresistant patients with partial epilepsy and
      many antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are substrates for PGP, MRP or both.

      It is logical to try to apply these observations to clinical practice. We hope that through
      co-administration of an inhibitor of transporter proteins, we can increase the CNS
      concentrations of AEDs, and subsequently improve seizure control. However, before this, it
      is critical to demonstrate that a transporter protein inhibitor can increase the
      concentration of AEDs in human brain.

      Probenecid is an MRP inhibitor while phenytoin is an MRP substrate. Evaluating whether
      probenecid can increase the CNS concentration of PHT can potentially be achieved
      noninvasively by using pharmaco-EEG.

      We plan to estimate the effect of probenecid (a transporter protein inhibitor) on the
      quantitative EEG recordings when it is administered to patients with pharmacoresistant
      epilepsy and in normal healthy volunteers.

      We plan to recruit two groups of 10 subjects each, normal volunteers and patients with
      pharmacoresistant epilepsy. They will undergo two treatment regimens; EEG recording after
      administration of intravenous phenytoin only and again after pre-dosing them with
      probenecid.

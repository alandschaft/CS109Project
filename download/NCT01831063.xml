  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caregivers of children with seizures receiving simulation based seizure management teaching
      in addition to the traditional seizure teaching will report more confidence with seizure
      management and demonstrate a higher level of performance with seizure management.

    <description>Caregivers performance managing a seizure scenario was assessed at baseline and at 48 hours after which time caregivers received their respective teaching sessions. Caregivers in the both groups participated in the traditional seizure teaching sessions. Caregivers in the intervention group received an additional simulation-based seizure teaching session that consisted of opportunities to practice seizure management in a simulated environment with instructor feedback and guidance. These sessions generally lasted 30 minutes and were deemed complete when caregivers were able to verbalize confidence with seizure management. The performance of caregivers in both groups were assessed again immediately after they received their respective teaching sessions which was usually the day of discharge.</description>

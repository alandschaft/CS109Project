      Prospective, observational, unblinded, multi-site study designed to collect data on patients
      implanted with a Model 106 VNS Therapy System from baseline through an EMU stay of up to 5
      days. After the EMU stay, patients will continue follow-up for safety for approximately two
      years or until final regulatory approval of the product.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a clinical diagnosis of medically refractory epilepsy dominated by
             partial seizures suitable for implantation with the Model 106 VNS Therapy System.

          -  Patients willing to undergo an EMU evaluation for a period of at least three days
             with activation of the AMM feature during that time.

          -  Patients must be at least 18 years old.

          -  Patients must be in good general health and ambulatory.

          -  Patient or guardian must be willing and able to complete informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients have had a bilateral or left cervical vagotomy.

          -  Patients currently use, or are expected to use, short-wave diathermy, microwave
             diathermy, or therapeutic ultrasound diathermy.

          -  A VNS Therapy System implant would (in the investigator's judgment) pose an
             unacceptable surgical or medical risk for the patient.

          -  Patients expected to require full body magnetic resonance imaging.

          -  Patients have a history of VNS Therapy.

          -  Patients with a significant psychiatric disorder, significant cognitive impairment,
             history of major depression, or suicidality as defined by DSM IV-TR that in the
             investigator's judgment would pose an unacceptable risk for the patient or prevent
             the patient's successful completion of the study.

          -  Patients with a history of status epileptic within 3 months of study enrollment.

          -  Patients with known clinically meaningful cardiovascular arrhythmias as well as
             patients with clinically meaningful cardiovascular arrhythmias determined by a
             24-hour Holter recording obtained at the baseline visit.

          -  Patients dependent on alcohol or narcotic drugs as defined by DSM IV-TR within the
             past 2 years.

          -  Patients with a history of only psychogenic or pseudo seizures.

          -  Women who are pregnant. Women of childbearing age must take a pregnancy test.

          -  Patients currently enrolled in another investigational study.

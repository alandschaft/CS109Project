    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, uncontrolled, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of lamotrigine monotherapy on newly diagnosed typical absence seizure in children and
      adolescents in Japan and South Korea.

      The study period is composed the baseline, fixed escalation phase, escalation phase,
      maintenance phase, taper phase, and post study examination. During the fixed escalation
      phase, the investigational product is administered at 0.3 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks (Week 1 to
      2), followed by 0.6 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks (Week 3 to 4). Subjects thereafter visit the
      clinic once every 1 to 2 weeks during the escalation phase to increase the dose by 0.6
      mg/kg/day up to a maximum of 10.2 mg/kg/day or 400 mg/day (whichever was less) until
      patients are confirmed to be seizure-free by HV tests for clinical signs. After seizure free
      is confirmed by HV-clinical signs, the dose is increased by one level and HV-EEG
      (electroencephalography) test (first test) is assessed at the next visit. If seizure free is
      observed by HV-EEG, the same dose is administered. Thereafter, HV-EEG (second test) is
      assessed at the next visit and if seizure free is confirmed again, the subjects enter the
      12-week maintenance phase. During the maintenance phase, patients visit the clinic once
      every 4 weeks. The dose can be adjusted as necessary within the range of 1.2 to 10.2
      mg/kg/day or 400 mg/day (whichever was less) taking into account the status of seizures and
      the safety. The investigational product is administered once daily (in the evening).
      However, if the number of tablets is large, twice-daily administration (in the morning and
      evening) is also allowed. After the completion of maintenance phase, subjects who have
      responded to lamotrigine without tolerability issues are eligible to enter the extension
      phase of the study if clinically indicated.

             these conditions are being controlled with chronic therapy.

          4. Subjects with an acute or chronic illness likely to impair drug absorption,
             distribution, metabolism or excretion or with any unstable physical symptoms likely
             to require hospitalization during participation in the study.

             of an agency, organisation, institution or entity by the courts, the government or a
             government body, acting in accordance with powers conferred on them by law or
             regulation. This can include a child cared for by foster parents or living in a care
             home or institution, provided that the arrangement falls within the definition above.
             The definition of a child in care does not include a child who is adopted or who has
             an appointed legal guardian.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants with newly diagnosed and untreated typical absence seizure; aged 2-15 years in Japan, 2-12 years in South Korea at the time of obtaining consent; weighing at least 7 kilograms (kg); without partial seizure or generalized seizures other than typical absence; and without a history of rash associated with other treatment were enrolled.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The study consisted of an Escalation Phase (EP), a 12-week (W) Maintenance Phase (MP), a &gt;=2-week Taper Phase, and post-study examination within 1-4 weeks after the last dose of lamotrigine. Participants could have entered the Extension Phase (ExP) until approval for this indication or until 24 months after the Last Subject Last Visit in the MP.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Lamotrigine</title>
          <description>In the EP, lamotrigine 0.3 milligrams per kilogram per day (mg/kg/day) was administered orally once daily from Week (W)1 to W2, and 0.6 mg/kg/day from W3 to W4. From W5, the dose was escalated by 0.6 mg/kg/day once every 1 or 2 weeks, up to a maximum of 10.2 mg/kg/day or 400 mg/day, whichever was less (WWL), until a seizure-free (SF) status was confirmed by hyperventilation (HV)-clinical signs. After a SF confirmation, the dose was increased by one level and HV-electroencephalography was assessed twice at the same dose level to confirm the SF status. In the MP, the same dose was continued for 12 weeks. An increase/decrease in dose (0.6 mg/kg/day at &gt;=1-week intervals) was allowed within the range of 1.2 to 10.2 mg/kg/day or 400 mg/day, WWL. In the ExP, doses of 1.2 to 10.2 mg/kg/day or 400 mg/day (WWL) were administered based on seizure status/safety. If a dose &lt;1.2 mg/kg/day or &gt;10.2 mg/kg/day or 400 mg/day (WWL) was necessary, the participant was withdrawn from the study.</description>

          <description>In the EP, lamotrigine 0.3 mg/kg/day was administered orally once daily from W1 to W2, and 0.6 mg/kg/day from W3 to W4. From W5, the dose was escalated by 0.6 mg/kg/day once every 1 or 2 weeks, up to a maximum of 10.2 mg/kg/day or 400 mg/day, WWL, until a SF status was confirmed by HV-clinical signs. After a SF confirmation, the dose was increased by one level and HV-electroencephalography was assessed twice at the same dose level to confirm the SF status. In the MP, the same dose was continued for 12 weeks. An increase/decrease in dose (0.6 mg/kg/day at &gt;=1-week intervals) was allowed within the range of 1.2 to 10.2 mg/kg/day or 400 mg/day, WWL. In the ExP, doses of 1.2 to 10.2 mg/kg/day or 400 mg/day (WWL) were administered based on seizure status/safety. If a dose &lt;1.2 mg/kg/day or &gt;10.2 mg/kg/day or 400 mg/day (WWL) was necessary, the participant was withdrawn from the study.</description>

        <description>EEG is a diagnostic test for epilepsy. The EEG machine records the brainâ€™s electrical activity as a series of waveforms. HV is an activation technique used to provoke seizures during an EEG recording. An approximately 30-minute EEG with HV was performed on participants in a supine position. In the HV test, participants breathed through their mouths deeply and rapidly (at a rate of approximately 20-25 breaths/minute) for 4 continuous minutes using a pin-wheel provided to them.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Were Seizure Free as Confirmed by HV-clinical Signs During Week 4 and Week 8 of the Maintenance Phase</title>
        <description>HV is an activation technique used to provoke seizures. Participants were instructed to breathe through their mouths deeply and rapidly (at a rate of approximately 20-25 breaths/minute) for 4 continuous minutes while sitting using a pin-wheel and were observed for clinical signs of seizures like impairment of consciousness; staring; eye enrollment; eye blinking; chewing movements; hand movement; other automatisms; atonic, tonic, clonic components; autonomic components; or any other signs. During the Maintenace Phase, HV-clinical signs were assessed at Visit 1 (Week 4) and Visit 2 (Week 4).</description>

            <description>In the EP, lamotrigine 0.3 mg/kg/day was administered orally once daily from W1 to W2, and 0.6 mg/kg/day from W3 to W4. From W5, the dose was escalated by 0.6 mg/kg/day once every 1 or 2 weeks, up to a maximum of 10.2 mg/kg/day or 400 mg/day, WWL, until a SF status was confirmed by HV-clinical signs. After a SF confirmation, the dose was increased by one level and HV-electroencephalography was assessed twice at the same dose level to confirm the SF status. In the MP, the same dose was continued for 12 weeks. An increase/decrease in dose (0.6 mg/kg/day at &gt;=1-week intervals) was allowed within the range of 1.2 to 10.2 mg/kg/day or 400 mg/day, WWL. In the ExP, doses of 1.2 to 10.2 mg/kg/day or 400 mg/day (WWL) were administered based on seizure status/safety. If a dose &lt;1.2 mg/kg/day or &gt;10.2 mg/kg/day or 400 mg/day (WWL) was necessary, the participant was withdrawn from the study.</description>

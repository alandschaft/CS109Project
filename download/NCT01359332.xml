  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Status EPILEPTICUS (SE) is a major medical emergency. The incidence per 100,000 population
      has been estimated at 9.9 episodes in Europe and 41 episodes in the US. The overall
      morbidity and mortality associated with convulsive SE (CSE) is 60% at three months. The
      alteration of functional prognosis of these patients is more conventionally attributed to
      the cause than to CSE itself. Longer seizure duration, progression to refractory status
      EPILEPTICUS and presence of cerebral insult are strong factors independently associated with
      a poor functional outcome. These three factors offer may be amenable to improvement and hope
      for preventive strategies. Current guidelines recommend the use of anticonvulsant treatment
      whose goal is prompt cessation of clinical and electrical seizures. None of these treatments
      has demonstrated NEUROPROTECTICE property. Therapeutic moderate hypothermia (between 32 and
      34 ° C) showed interest in neuroprotection of post anoxic coma patients after a
      cardiovascular arrest on ventricular fibrillation by reducing morbidity and mortality in
      about 20% without major side effects. This technique has been used successfully in various
      pathologies such as stroke or traumatic brain injury. Pathophysiological mechanisms involved
      in epileptogenesis and neurotoxicity induced by persistence of seizures can be blocked by
      therapeutic hypothermia. Recent work on experimental models of SE demonstrated
      neuroprotective and anticonvulsant interest of therapeutic hypothermia. Therapeutic
      hypothermia has also been successfully used in some cases of particularly refractory CSE.
      Its early use in patients with SE would have a double interest: neuroprotective and
      anticonvulsant. There is currently no published studies or ongoing to determine the interest
      of its early use in patients with CSE.

      Thus, the current study AIMAS at evaluating the effectiveness of the implementation of a
      procedure of moderate hypothermia therapy, between 32 ° and 34 ° C for 24 hours, to reduce
      morbidity and mortality at 3 months (+ / - 1 week) in mechanically ventilated ICU patients
      with convulsive status EPILEPTICUS.

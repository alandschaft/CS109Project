      The purpose of this study is to determine if bone marrow progenitor cell (BMPC) autologous
      transplantation in children after isolated traumatic brain injury is safe and will improve
      functional outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) contributes to 50% of all trauma deaths. The mortality rate for
      children following severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale &lt; 9) ranges from 14-24%. There is
      currently no therapy to reverse the primary injury associated with TBI. Bone marrow
      precursor cells (BMPC) or bone marrow mononuclear cellular fractions of bone marrow contain
      mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and hematopoetic stem cells (HSC). These cells are a component
      of bone marrow that preferentially migrate to the site of brain injury and differentiate
      into neurons and cell supporting elements, improving functional outcome in animals. The
      primary objective of this study is to determine if BMPC harvest and autologous
      transplantation is safe in children after TBI. The secondary objective is to determine if
      late functional outcome is improved with BMPC autologous transplantation compared to age and
      severity matched concomitant controls. Safety will be determined by monitoring cerebral and
      systemic hemodynamics during harvest and transplantation, neurologic events (seizure, change
      in GCS, stroke), local site inflammation/injury, and secondary organ injury. Late outcomes
      will be determined using age-corrected Glasgow Outcome Scores, and a battery of functional
      outcome measures. In vitro, an aliquot of cells harvested from patients will be studied for
      labeling with magnetodendrimers as a feasibility study, and these cells will not be
      reinfused into the patients. The primary endpoint is to assess the safety of autologous BMPC
      harvest/transplantation in the acute injury phase (hospital stay) and the secondary endpoint
      is to assess efficacy through 1 and 6 month post-injury follow-up. The rationale for the use
      of autologous BMPC transplantation is based on a large volume of in vitro and in vivo animal
      data (see background and significance section). The rationale for using children as the
      primary population is that children have a greater neurologic plasticity with a unique
      injury pattern when compared to adults. Children are more likely to have isolated TBI that
      is more diffuse and less likely to be secondary to extra-axial fluid collections. Patients
      aged 5-14 years old with GCS of 5-8 will be considered for enrollment into the study. Within
      24-36 hours of injury, enrolled patients will undergo bone marrow harvest/BMPC separation
      and re-infusion. Daily monitoring of the safety outcomes measures and long term neurologic
      outcomes will be performed. This study should determine if bone marrow harvest, BMPC
      separation, and reinfusion is safe in children after severe TBI.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and test the feasibility of using a specific
      pharmacological protocol to reduce delirium burden among older adults in the Intensive Care
      Unit (ICU). The study will test the efficacy of a pharmacological intervention in reducing
      delirium severity and duration as well as length of stay and mortality compared to usual
      care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2005, approximately 2.7 million Americans aged 65 and older spent at least one day in the
      intensive care unit (ICU), costing Medicare an estimated $27.5 billion. It is estimated that
      while hospitalized, up to 80% of these older ICU patients had delirium, an acute brain
      failure that is an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality which often goes
      unrecognized. Older adults with delirium are more prone to falls, injuries, pressure ulcers
      and restraints, complications which may also contribute to prolonged ICU and hospital length
      of stay, higher mortality rates, poorer functional status, limited rehabilitation, increased
      institutionalization, and higher health care costs. The literature supports treatment with a
      combination of a reduction in the use of benzodiazepines and anticholinergics and the use of
      low-dose neuroleptics such as haloperidol. However, there have been no randomized controlled
      trials evaluating the efficacy of this approach on reducing delirium severity, duration, and
      complications.

      Building upon the e-CHAMP study, (&quot;Enhancing Care for Hospitalized Older Adults With Memory
      Problems;&quot; see NCT00182832), a recently completed quality improvement project tested the
      effectiveness of cognitive screening coupled with computerized decision support in reducing
      delirium and other hospital-related complications among 424 older adults hospitalized on the
      medical wards, which found that many of the older adults entering the study had already
      experienced delirium in the ICU prior to their transfer to the wards. This study will test a
      pharmacologic intervention that allows a more targeted approach to the care of older adults
      with delirium while still recognizing the clinicians' role in controlling symptoms and
      providing intensive care.

      The hypothesis is that patients in the intervention arm as compared to usual care will have:

        -  reduced delirium severity, as measured by the Delirium Rating Scale (DRS-R-98), at one
           week following randomization or hospital discharge

        -  fewer hospital days with delirium or coma as determined by the Confusion Assessment
           Method in the ICU (CAM-ICU)

        -  shorter hospital lengths of stay

        -  lower ICU, hospital, and 30-day mortality

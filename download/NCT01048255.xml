        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects that are male or female aged 18 to 64 years (inclusive) with a body mass
             index between 18 and 35 (kg/m2)

          -  Subjects must have a diagnosis and history of treatment resistant partial onset
             seizures for which they are taking 1 to 4 concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AED).
             Treatment resistance is defined as failure to achieve seizure freedom despite
             adequate use of 2 different AEDs. All AED doses must remain stable for 4 weeks prior
             to the Screening Visit and throughout the entire study

          -  Subjects must have had at least 1 electroencephalogram (EEG) consistent with partial
             epilepsy and a brain magnetic resource imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan
             within 5 years of Screening Visit negative for other confounding conditions

          -  Subjects must have had at least 6 observable partial seizures in 6 weeks prior to
             randomization, with at least 1 seizure per week during 3 of the 6 weeks within the
             Baseline Period

          -  Subjects who are male or female must agree to use acceptable contraceptive methods as
             defined in the protocol

          -  Subjects who are in otherwise good health

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a history of non-epileptic transient alterations in consciousness

          -  Subjects who have a history of status epilepticus in the past 12 months

          -  Subjects whose seizure frequency cannot be quantified

          -  Subjects who have significant medical illness including kidney, liver, pulmonary or
             gastrointestinal disease; or unstable or poorly controlled conditions

          -  Subjects who have clinically significant psychiatric illness

          -  Subjects with a positive drug screen (excluding any allowed prescribed medications)
             and history of alcoholism or drug addiction within past 2 years

          -  Males subjects that have a female partner of childbearing potential who do not agree
             to use medically approved methods of birth control

          -  Male subjects that have a female partner who is pregnant, nursing, or is planning to
             become pregnant during the study period, or within 90 days of the last dose of study
             drug

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating, or who are of reproductive potential
             who do not agree to use medically approved birth-control methods

          -  Subjects with a current or prior history of illness precluding them from
             immunomodulatory therapy (e.g. history of recurrent infections)

          -  Subjects with active hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

          -  Subjects who have participated in any other clinical trials involving an
             investigational product or device and have received the last dose of study drug
             within 45 days or 5 half-lives of the Screening Visit

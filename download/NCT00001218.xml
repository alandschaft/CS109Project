  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our past ultrasound research has indicated a need for baseline normative tongue data against
      which to compare our disordered speech populations. Subjects with normal speech and hearing
      who represent different ages and sexes, will be studied with respect to tongue shape and
      movement patterns. Recently developed parameters such as curve fitting, curve averaging, and
      polar coordinates will be used to create baseline data categories. In addition, new
      parameters and improved instruments will be developed as previously to produce a data base
      which can be used across disciplines.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this proposal is to provide quantitative dose-response data for effects of
      GLP-1 on myocardial glucose uptake in healthy control subjects and obese type 2 diabetic
      subjects, in support of the design of later studies evaluating therapeutic applications of
      GLP-1 to heart disease.

      Aim 1: To measure the effects of GLP-1 infusion on myocardial fuel selection in lean healthy
      humans under fasting (fatty acid-dominant) conditions. Four groups of 10 lean healthy
      subjects will be studied during infusions of 0 (saline control), 0.5, 1.5, and 4.0
      pmol/kg/min GLP-1 (one study per subject). Cardiac metabolism will be measured using PET,
      using a dual-tracer approach which allows measurement of myocardial glucose uptake (the
      primary endpoint) along with total oxidation rate and myocardial perfusion (secondary
      endpoints). In concert with measures of circulating metabolites and regulatory hormones, the
      investigators will produce the most comprehensive assessment of actions of GLP-1 on
      myocardial metabolism in humans to date. Effects of each dose will be compared to the saline
      control, plus the investigators will combine all data and use nonlinear curve-fitting to
      derive sensitivity (ED50) and maximal responses for GLP-1 effects on myocardial glucose
      uptake.

      Aim 2: To measure the effects of GLP-1 infusion on myocardial fuel selection in obese type 2
      diabetic humans under fasting (fatty acid-dominant) conditions Four groups of 10 obese type
      2 diabetic subjects will be studied during infusions of 0, 0.5, 1.5, and 4.0 pmol/kg/min
      GLP-1 as under Aim 1. Analyses will be parallel to those described under Aim 1. Results from
      Aims 1 and 2 will be combined to allow direct comparison of the dose-response between
      nondiabetic control and type 2 diabetic subjects.

      No literature has been published to inform dose selection in the design of clinical trials
      of GLP-1 for modulation of heart fuel selection. With our expertise and experience in PET
      measurement of heart metabolism in diabetes, the investigators are uniquely positioned to
      fill this gap in knowledge. These studies are a necessary preamble to further evaluation of
      the potential for GLP-1 based treatments in heart disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18-60

          -  Lean subjects will be defined as having a BMI &lt;25 kg/m2, in good general health,
             taking no regular medications

          -  Diabetic subjects will be obese (BMI &gt;30 kg/m2 but &lt;40 kg/m2), HbA1c 7.0-10.0%,
             treated with diet and exercise plus oral agents or injected insulin. All diabetic
             subjects will be treated with injected insulin for 2 weeks prior to study, to avoid
             potential confounding effects of other antidiabetic agents.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known coronary artery disease or abnormal ECG on screening evaluation

          -  Blood pressure &gt; 160/100 mmHg on two occasions during screening evaluations. Current
             use of 3 or fewer blood pressure medications with blood pressure below this cutpoint
             will be acceptable.

          -  Total cholesterol &gt; 240 mg/dL. Current use of 2 or fewer lipid lowering agents with
             cholesterol below this cutpoint will be acceptable.

          -  Diabetic subjects: Treatment with a GLP-1 agonist or DPP4 inhibitor within the past 6
             months

          -  Known intolerance to injected GLP-1 agonist

          -  Treatment with PPAR gamma agonists currently or within the past 6 months

          -  Recognized microvascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy)

          -  Unwillingness or inability to use injected insulin for the purposes of this study

          -  Chronic pain or other physical conditions which limit ability to remain supine for
             the duration of the study protocol

          -  History of claustrophobia, musculoskeletal or other factors which would result in an
             inability to comfortably remain within PET scanner gantry for the duration of the
             imaging protocol

          -  Occupational, investigational or other known radiation exposure which, together with
             the planned radiologic studies, will result in greater than 500 mrem total exposure
             in a contiguous 12 month period

          -  For female participants, current pregnancy

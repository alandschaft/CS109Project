  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study looks at advanced airway management in critically ill or injured patients treated
      by physician manned emergency medical services, comparing early (on-scene) intubation to
      late (emergency department) intubation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ELITE trial is a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare competent
      EARLY-intubation to LATE-intubation in patients with on-scene Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) &lt; 9
      and short ambulance transport times (&lt; 20 min) to hospital.

      The study aims to establish if advanced airway management with endotracheal intubation (ETI)
      in the field by specially trained Emergency Medical Services (EMS) physicians - compared to
      endotracheal intubation (ETI) performed by physicians in the emergency department in the
      same group - improves outcome in terms of 30-day mortality, degree of disability at
      discharge, complications and length of hospital stay, and neurologic outcome at 6 months.

    <description>Early intubation is defined as prehospital intubation on the scene of the patient illness/injury, or where the EMS physician first meets the patient (e.g en route to hospital). Intubation includes drug assisted and/or rapid sequence intubation (RSI) with endotracheal tube.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Late intubation</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Late intubation is defined as on-scene prehospital high-flow (&gt; 10 L/min) supplemental oxygen by mask, assisted bag-mask-ventilation by EMS physician if required and stable recovery position during transport to hospital. Intubation should be done on arrival in the emergency department.</description>

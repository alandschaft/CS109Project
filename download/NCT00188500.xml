  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients with uncontrolled epilepsy can
      follow a low carbohydrate diet long-term and if so, how will that diet affect their seizures

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the management of drug-resistant epilepsy, many strategies have been examined. The
      Ketogenic Diet, high in fats and low in all other nutrients was observed to be of benefit.
      However, due to its complexedness and unpalatability, this diet is rarely used in the adult
      population. A recent small study showed seizure reduction with the Atkins Diet.

      In this study, patients will be randomized into one of 2 groups- group 1 receiving limited
      dietary instruction for the Atkins Diet and group 2- receiving detailed dietary instruction.
      A seizure severity-matched control group will also take part. We will follow these patients
      over a period of 2 years looking at seizure frequency, weight, sustainability of the diet,
      effect on anti-epilepsy medication dosage, effect in cognition, quality of life and
      financial impact of the diet.

      Patients will come to clinic to see the dietitian at specific intervals. cognitive testing
      will also be done at the beginning of the study and every 6 months thereafter. Patients will
      keep food charts, ketosis charts and seizure diaries.

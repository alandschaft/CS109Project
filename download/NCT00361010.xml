  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) is a form of generalized epilepsy syndrome. Clinically
      these seizures are manifest with a sudden, brief (3-15 second) loss of awareness followed by
      a quick recovery to baseline. Keppra (levetiracetam) is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) to treat partial seizures in adults. It is currently being studied in
      children with partial seizures. Absence seizures can be difficult to detect clinically,
      therefore the response to therapy will be determined both by clinical observation and by 24
      hour EEG recordings. The researchers hope that with this information they will learn how
      well it works for the treatment of childhood absence epilepsy and at what dose. This is an
      open-label, dose-ranging pilot study of levetiracetam in subjects with newly diagnosed
      childhood absence epilepsy. Approximately 20 patients will be needed to study effectiveness
      and dose requirements. Subjects must not be on any antiepileptic medication at the time of
      entry into the study. Male and female subjects from the ages of 4 to 10 years of age may
      participate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12 week ( 12 week treatment phase), dose ranging pilot study on the effectiveness
      of levetiracetam for the treatment of childhood absence epilepsy. It consists of 1 phase.
      The treatment phase where the optimal medication dose will be defined. Absence seizures are
      often brief and subtle with no postictal manifestations. As a result, clinical observation
      alone is inadequate to assess the seizure Therefore, both subjective clinical response
      (parental/caregiver assessment) and EEG recordings are an important part of evaluation of
      treatment response. A 6 hour outpatient video-EEG study (including 3 minutes of
      hyperventilation), followed by an 18 hour ambulatory EEG recording - for total 24 hour EEG
      recording will be done before treatment and every 2 weeks after each dose plateau is reached
      )

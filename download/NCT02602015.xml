  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to improve the treatment of neonatal seizures. Current treatments are
      poorly effective and have significant side effects. Levetiracetam has great potential as a
      treatment for neonatal seizures but is not approved for use in children less than 1 years of
      age by oral. This study aims to obtain essential data regarding the efficacy and safety of
      oral Levetiracetam in neonatal population and simultaneously to use EEG monitoring systems
      that facilitate seizure detection and research.

      1. To determine the efficacy of oral Levetiracetam in terminating neonatal seizures by EEG
           in the Neonatal Neurological Intensive Care Unit (NNICU).

        2. To determine dose escalation data by studying the additional efficacy of a further dose
           in non responders.

        3. To determine additional pharmacokinetic data to confirm findings from our previous
           pharmacokinetic study.

        4. To determine further safety data of oral Levetiracetam in neonates.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an urgent need to understand the psychological and situational factors that
      influence medication adherence in individuals with epilepsy. According to the Center for
      Disease Control (CDC, 2010) about 2.5 million people in the United States have epilepsy and
      one third of them still have seizures despite receiving treatment. With proper medication,
      an estimated 60-70% of individuals with new onset epilepsy become, and remain, seizure free
      (Kwan &amp; Brodie, 2000). Despite the success of medical treatment of epilepsy, many patients
      do not receive these benefits due to inadequate adherence to medication (Meyer et al.,
      2010). And, as with other chronic medical conditions, estimates suggest that between 30% and
      60% of patients with epilepsy are not adherent with their drug regimens (Green &amp; Simons
      Morton, 1988; Leppik, 1990; Jones et al., 2006). Poor adherence may be the most important
      cause of poorly controlled epilepsy (Gomes et al., 1998). Stanaway et al. (1985) found that
      31% of seizures were precipitated by nonadherence to medication.

      Questions regarding adherence are theoretically informed by Fisher et al. (2006)'s
      Information Motivation Behavioral Skills (IMB) model. While originally developed to
      describe, predict, and inform interventions for antiretroviral treatment for human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV), this study applies the model to epilepsy for the first time.
      In addition, this study intends to produce an accurate description of how individuals with
      epilepsy manage their medication adherence by identifying current self regulation strategies
      (immediate adherence behaviors, preparatory behaviors, and barrier management strategies)
      and their situational determinants. Situational determinants can explain some of the
      fluctuations in medication adherence. Patients who are motivated to take their medications
      might still show inconsistent medication adherence. For example, patients might miss good
      opportunities to take their medication or fail to anticipate unexpected barriers such as a
      spontaneous dinner with friends or a bout of depression. Therefore, the study will take
      particular care to investigate situational cues such as good opportunities for adherence
      (e.g., taking medication with regular meals or before brushing teeth) and expected and
      unexpected barriers. Preparatory behaviors and their cues are also of interest in this
      study: Some patients use facilitators (such as physical or electronic reminder systems,
      electronic pill bottles and pill boxes) to ensure adequate medication adherence. Social
      support can serve a similar function of reminding patients to take their medication. To
      address these questions, the investigators plan to explore how individual regulation and
      social support influence medication adherence in patients with epilepsy. The specific aims
      of the proposed research are:

        1. To test the hypothesis that there will be a main effect of information, motivation and
           behavioral skills, on adherence behavior, and that a mediation model will show that
           information and motivation effects are partially mediated through behavioral skills.

        2. To identify self regulation strategies and their situational cues (good opportunities,
           facilitators, and barriers) for medication adherence among individuals with epilepsy to
           better describe best practices and challenges.

        A total of 140 participants between 18 and 65 years old will be recruited with the
        condition that all participants have been diagnosed with epilepsy. The participants will
        be of diverse ethnic background. It is estimated that the participant population will also
        include individuals from a disadvantaged socioeconomic and/or educational background.

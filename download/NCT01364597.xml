      with epilepsy.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, open-label, single-arm, multicenter, long-term study to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of brivaracetam (BRV) in children with epilepsy.

      This study was initially designed for pediatric subjects who had completed a previous BRV
      study. With Protocol Amendment 3, enrollment was expanded to include up to additional 100
      subjects as &quot;directly enrolled subjects&quot; ≥4 years to &lt;17 years of age with partial-onset
      seizures (POS) who had not previously enrolled in a pediatric BRV study.

      With Protocol Amendment 4, enrollment for &quot;directly enrolled&quot; subjects was modified from 'up
      to' an additional 100 subjects to &quot;at least&quot; 100 subjects, keeping the planned total
      enrollment of approximately 600 subjects to allow flexibility in the number of patients
      reaching 1 year of exposure.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of BRV. The
      secondary objective is to assess the efficacy of BRV during long-term exposure.

    <description>Subjects entering this study from the previous study must be able to tolerate at least 0.4 mg/kg of brivaracetam twice daily (bid) if ≥8 years of age or at least 0.5 mg/kg bid if &lt;8 years of age.</description>

    <description>Subjects must be able to tolerate at least 0.5 mg/kg of brivaracetam twice daily (bid). The maximum allowable brivaracetam dose is 5.0 mg/kg/day (2.5 mg/kg bid), not to exceed a dose of 200 mg/day for subjects with body weight &gt;40 kg. Subjects &lt;7 years of age will receive oral solution.
Subjects ≥7 years of age will receive tablets and should transition from the oral solution to the equivalent oral tablet dose. The maximum BRV tablet dose allowed in this study will be 200 mg/day (100 mg bid).
Subjects will continue to receive brivaracetam in this study for at least 3 years, or until approval for BRV has been obtained for pediatric subjects in their age range, or until the investigational product development is stopped by the Sponsor.
For subjects who prematurely discontinue the study, brivaracetam will be down titrated over a maximum of 4 weeks (Down-Titration Period).</description>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), is considered the most effective treatment for severe
      treatment resistant major depressive disorder (MDD), but it requires about 3 weeks of
      treatments and can cause considerable acute deficits in memory. It would be a major advance
      in treatment if ECT could work faster with fewer treatments and result in decrease incidence
      of memory problems. Ketamine is an excellent candidate for augmentation of ECT because of
      its acute effects on depression, its short half-life, and its safety profile when given at
      low doses. Ketamine is given as an infusion and could easily be incorporated into the
      routine management of patients undergoing ECT, but has never been evaluated prospectively in
      this context.

      The investigators propose to assess the efficacy, feasibility, tolerability and safety of
      N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist augmentation of ECT using ketamine.

      Aim #1: To assess the efficacy of ketamine augmentation in reducing time to remission of a
      major depressive episode (MDE).

      Aim #2: To assess the efficacy of ketamine augmentation on ECT-related cognitive side
      effects.

      Aim #3: To assess the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of ketamine augmentation of ECT.

      Exploratory aim #4: We propose to assess the patterns of functional connectivity before,
      during and after ECT using standard clinical EEG to better characterize the effect of ECT
      and to correlate clinical effects with changes in EEG measurements.

      Thirty (30) participants will be recruited over 24 months. Participants will be males and
      females, ages 18-60, with severe MDD (baseline score HAM_D-28 &gt;= 20) deemed appropriate for
      ECT treatment by their treating physician, agreeing to receive ECT treatment as part of
      their clinical care, and able to provide informed consent.

      Exclusion criteria are any other DSM-IV primary diagnoses including major depressive
      disorder with psychotic features, bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia,
      dementia, any history of psychosis, substance use disorder (abuse or dependence with active
      use within the last 6 months), and any lifetime history of ketamine abuse or dependence,
      organic mental disorders, seizure disorder or chronic antiepileptic medications, severe or
      unstable medical illness, pregnancy.

      Study procedures: eligible patients will be randomized to a double-blind administration of
      ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or saline before the first three ECT treatments. Right Unilateral ECT
      (RUL-ECT) will be administered at 6 times the seizure threshold, using the d'Elia placement
      of the electrodes. Electroconvulsive therapy will be given 3 times per week, as per standard
      of care at MGH. Depression severity will be assessed weekly with the HAM-D 28 (the main
      outcome measure), administered by a clinician blinded to randomization.

      The neuropsychological assessment battery is designed to include instruments sensitive to
      the cognitive impairment associated with depression in general and ECT treatment in
      particular will be repeated at baseline, at the end of acute treatment series and at 3
      months follow-up.

      Also patients will undergo repeated EEG monitoring, at baseline after one week of treatment
      and at follow up with the aim of possibly identifying EEG features associated with response.

      This is an 18-week, double-blind, randomized, historical control, multicenter study with
      gradual conversion to monotherapy in subjects with partial onset seizures who are not well
      controlled by current AEDs. The 18 week double-blind treatment period consists of a 2-week
      titration period, 6-week taper or conversion period, and a 10-week monotherapy period. This
      study was previously posted by Sepracor Inc. In October 2009, Sepracor Inc. was acquired by
      Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma., and in October 2010, Sepracor Inc's name was changed to Sunovion
      Pharmaceuticals Inc.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of partial epilepsy as defined in the Classification of Seizures of the
             International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) (simple partial seizures with observable
             motor component, or complex, with or without secondary generalization)

               -  Medical history of seizures;

               -  Absence of confounding factors (pseudoseizures, syncope);

               -  Documented EEG recording (done within 5 years prior to screening) consistent
                  with focal onset epilepsy

          -  Documented CT or MRI scan conducted within 10 years prior to screening, showing the
             absence of a structural abnormality (eg, tumor or malformation)

          -  ≥ 4 partial onset seizures during the 8 weeks prior screening with no 28-day seizure
             free period

             the informed consent to the subject must sign the consent form on behalf of the
             subject.

          -  Subjects must give written informed consent prior to participation in the study. For
             subjects &lt;18 years of age, the informed consent must be signed by the subject's
             parent or legal guardian, and, when appropriate and/or required by state or local
             law, minor subjects must give written informed assent prior to participation in the

             genotyping. All subjects must sign a HIPAA Form. All females of child bearing
             potential must also sign the &quot;Women of Childbearing Potential&quot; Addendum.

                  including any female who is pre-menarchal or post-menopausal);

               -  Child-bearing potential (all females ≤65 years of age), has a negative pregnancy
                  test at screening and agrees to satisfy contraception requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of generalized seizure syndromes (eg, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy or
             Lennox-Gastaut syndrome)

          -  History of pseudo-seizures

          -  Current seizures related to an acute medical illness

          -  Seizures secondary to metabolic, toxic or infectious disorder or drug abuse

          -  Status epilepticus within 2 years prior to screening

          -  Seizures only occurring in a cluster pattern

          -  Subjects taking 2 of the following sodium channel blocking AEDs: phenytoin,
             carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, or lamotrigine

          -  Subjects taking 2 AEDs with both being in the upper dose range (defined as
             approximately two-thirds of the defined daily dose)

          -  Subjects taking more than 2 AEDs

          -  Subjects with progressive structural central nervous system lesion or progressive
             encephalopathy

          -  Psychiatric exclusion criteria

          -  Medical exclusion criteria: known renal insufficiency (estimated creatinine clearance
             [CrCL]) &lt;60 mL/min based on serum creatinine using the Cockcroft-Gault formula

          -  Clinical and laboratory exclusion criteria: Subjects of Asian ancestry who tests
             positive for the presence of the HLA-B*1502 allele

          -  Subjects who have been on benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, or primidone on a regular
             basis within 3 months prior to screening

          -  Subjects taking antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, anxiolytics, sedative
             hypnotics including non-benzodiazepines, central opioid agonists/antagonists,
             monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) within at least 5 half lives (or for at least 2
             weeks whichever is longer) prior to randomization

          -  Subjects presently on felbamate or vigabatrin

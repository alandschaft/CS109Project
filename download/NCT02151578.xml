  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A well-implemented community-based program of early and appropriate treatment of
      fevers/malaria episodes and pneumonia,will improve child survival as measured by a reduction
      of the less than five mortality rate.

    <textblock>
      An integrated approach of home and community management of malaria and pneumonia may
      increase the proportion of children receiving prompt treatment; improve child survival as
      measured by a reduction of the under five mortality rate. To test this hypothesis, a cluster
      randomised controlled trial will be performed, involving children less than 5 years of age,
      in Burkina Faso using a community-based supplying community health workers (CHWs), a core
      group of mothers (KOLs) with Coartem and cotrimoxazole specially packed in age-specific
      blisters containing a full course of treatment. The study will be carried out in 111
      clusters of a rural district in Burkina Faso where malaria and pneumonia are two major
      mortality causes in under five mortality.

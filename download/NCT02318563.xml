    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 study will enroll subjects diagnosed with Dravet Syndrome (DS) who are still
      experiencing at least one tonic-clonic, clonic, and/or focal seizures with motor components
      (FSMC) per week, despite ongoing treatment with up to three antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and
      meet the other inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      Following a 28-day baseline period, subjects will begin an 84-day treatment period.
      Participants will be assigned to receive twice-daily doses of placebo or cannabidiol oral
      solution at the highest dose determined to be safe in a previous trial.

      Following study completion, all subjects will be invited to receive Cannabidiol Oral
      Solution in an open label extension study (under a separate protocol).

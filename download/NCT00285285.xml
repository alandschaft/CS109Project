  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the effect of “point-of-care” (POC) analysis of blood work with traditional
      laboratory methods on length of stay in a pediatric emergency department (PED).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was a prospective, randomized controlled study of patients requiring blood work
      that a POC device was capable of performing. Length of time spent at various timepoints were
      prospectively recorded by a dedicated research assistant after randomization.

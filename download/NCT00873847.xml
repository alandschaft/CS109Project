      This observational study tests the feasibility of enrolling subjects and obtaining an
      amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram (aEEG) within the first 72 hours of life, a second
      aEEG recording between 72-168 hours of life, and weekly thereafter up to 36 weeks
      post-menstrual age. It will enroll 85-100 infants between 401-1,000 grams birth weight OR
      between 23 0/7 and 28 6/7 weeks gestational age born at the 7 participating NICHD Neonatal
      Research Network sites.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Few techniques exist to permit early and accurate prognosis of brain injury in newborns.
      Cranial ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been used to detect structural
      abnormalities which may be useful in predicting neuromotor and neurocognitive deficits.
      However, up to 30% of extremely low birth weight infants with normal ultrasounds have
      adverse outcomes, and MRI is not feasible when an infant is critically ill.
      Amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram (aEEG) is a non-invasive, bedside instrument which
      allows real-time monitoring of brain function and may provide additional information for
      predicting outcomes in extremely premature infants.

      This observational study will enroll 85-100 infants between 401-1,000 grams birth weight OR
      between 23 0/7 and 28 6/7 weeks gestational age born at the 7 participating NICHD Neonatal
      Research Network sites. Eligible infants will undergo an aEEG recording in the first 72
      hours of life, a second aEEG recording between 72-168 hours of life, and weekly thereafter
      up to 36 weeks post-menstrual age.

      The study tests the feasibility of enrolling subjects and obtaining the required aEEG
      recordings. The information gathered will provide a framework for the design of a potential
      prospective, observational, multi-center study for prediction of death or neurodevelopmental
      impairment by 18-22 months of age.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale behind this clinical performance investigation is to collect data regarding
      the usability of the Baha Attract System in patients with hearing impairment that are
      candidates for Baha surgery:

        -  To describe the expected hearing performance with the Baha Attract in comparison to
           unaided hearing thresholds or a pre-test situation using a sound processor together
           with a softband

        -  Which sound processor to select, i.e. BP100 vs BP110

        -  Improve the fitting process for the sound processor

        -  Selection of sound processor magnet at time of fitting and over time

    <description>Perform feedback measurements and investigate if this changes over time. Feedback is a measure of how much sound from the actuator (vibrator) returns to the microphones thus creating a loop of sound which sounds like high pitch noise. Measuring this is a part of the performance of the system, i.e how much gain can the sound processor produce before feedback occurs. Unit of measure is dB re output.</description>

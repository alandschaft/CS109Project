      The main purpose of this part of the study is to determine the Central Nervous System
      bioavailability of sulfasalazine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, open-label, non-randomized, study to determine the effect that orally
      administered sulfasalazine has on glutamate levels as measured by MRS and on epileptiform
      spiking as measured by simultaneous MEG/EEG. The intent of the dose escalation is to
      determine an Optimal Biological Dose (OBD) based on changes in tumor glutamate levels. The
      OBD is defined as the dose that has the maximal reduction in tumor glutamate levels after
      normalization to uninvolved brain.

    <description>Sulfasalazine has been the parent aminosalicylate in use for over 40 years in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. The drug is a conjugate of sulfapyridine linked to 5-aminosalicylic acid. In inflammatory bowel disease, the 5-ASA component is the active moiety
Sulfasalazine is a prodrug that consists of sulfapyridine bonded to mesalamine (5-ASA). Sulfasalazine is cleaved by colonic bacterial azo-reductases into sulfapyridine and the 5-ASA moiety. 5-ASA is metabolized to N-acetyl-5-ASA by an enzyme in the intestinal epithelium and the liver and then excreted in the urine as a mixture of free 5ASA and N-acetyl-5-ASA.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must be &gt; 18 years of age or older.

          2. Patients must have histologically proven low grade astrocytoma,anaplastic
             astrocytoma, anaplastic mixed glioma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma,glioblastoma
             multiforme, astrocytoma WHO II,oligodendroglioma WHO II or mixed glioma WHO II.
             Patients do not haveto demonstrate progressive disease to participate in this study.

          3. Patients must have completed initial glioma therapy involving radiation and be 3
             months from the completion of radiation therapy. If initial glioma therapy did not
             include radiation (example: anaplastic oligodendroglioma), then 2 cycles of
             chemotherapy must be completed prior to study entry.

          4. Patients must be maintained on a stable corticosteroid regimen for &gt; 5 days prior to
             entry.

          5. Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status &gt; 60% (i.e. the patient must be
             able to care for himself/herself with occasional help from others).

          6. Patients must have adequate hematologic, renal and liver function (i.e. Absolute
             neutrophil count &gt; 1500/mm3, Platelets &gt; 100,000/mm3, creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dl.

          7. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test.

          8. Patients with the potential for pregnancy or impregnating their partner must agree to
             follow acceptable birth control methods to avoid conception. The effect of the
             investigational drugs on the developing human fetus is not known, but these drugs are
             likely to be harmful to the developing fetus or nursing infant. Women of
             child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (either surgical
             sterilization; approved hormonal contraceptives such as birth control pills:
             Depo-Provera, or Lupron Depot; barrier methods such as condom or diaphragm along with
             spermicide; or an IUD). Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician and study
             PI immediately.

          9. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or breast feeding.

          2. Exclude sexually active males and females unwilling to practice contraception during
             the study.

          3. Serious concurrent infections.

          4. Clinically significant cardiac disease not well controlled with medication (e.g.
             congestive heart failure, symptomatic coronary artery disease and cardiac
             arrhythmias) or myocardial infarction within the last 12 months.

          5. Patients with other serious uncontrolled co-morbid diseases that the investigator
             feels may comprise the study findings.

          6. Allergic or sensitivity to sulfa containing medications.

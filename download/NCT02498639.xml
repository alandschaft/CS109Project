    <textblock>
      Pilot interventional study, without drug, randomized 1: 1, open-label comparison of efficacy
      and safety between the technique of percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty without rapid
      ventricular pacing vs valvuloplasty during rapid ventricular pacing (using a temporary
      pacemaker device with CE mark). It is expected to enroll 100 patients. Randomization is done
      through a dedicated computer program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to compare, in terms of procedural success and safety, the procedure of
      percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) without rapid ventricular pacing with the
      same procedure carried out with the aid of rapid ventricular pacing.

      It is a pilot study with the objective to enroll 100 consecutive patients matching inclusion
      and exclusion criteria who are randomized 1:1 in two arms: in the first patients undergo
      procedure of BAV without rapid pacing, in the second BAV with rapid ventricular pacing able
      to help in balloon stabilization during inflations.

      Efficacy will be studied analysing changes in transvalvular gradient from baseline to
      post-BAV. Safety outcomes will be collected both at discharge and at 30-day. Other
      procedural data will be object of direct comparison.

    <intervention_name>percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty</intervention_name>
    <description>Percutaneous BAV is performed according to the standard retrograde technique. The measurement of the trans-aortic gradient is given by two catheters placed one in the left ventricle, the other in ascending aorta. An extra stiff wire is placed in the left ventricular cavity. A balloon (size fitting the valve annulus) is inserted over the wire and a series of three inflations is performed at nominal pressure.
The procedure terminates in case of:
Reduction of the mean aortic gradient ≥50%.
Aortic pressure drop during the inflations, indicative of valve orifice sealing.
Intraprocedural complication.
Poor compliance of the patient. If none is met, the balloon is changed with a bigger one and a new series of three inflations performed. Aortic gradient is finally recorded.</description>

    <description>A multifaceted intervention program was used to improve adherence and clinical outcomes in epileptic patients. However, this study mainly focused on behavioral treatment in the patients.
Patient's intervention A three-week session will perform to improve medication adherence in patients in the intervention group. Face to face introductory motivational interviews (MI) will conduct to resolve patient ambivalence about change.
Besides providingthe intervention for the patients, the health care team and the patient's family member will receive a brief intervention.All GPs and nurses as well as patients' family members participate in a single session MI with the same procedure</description>

    <description>All participants of the study in both group receive the Standard Care. Usually, patients in clinics receive a one-time session of brief advice to use medications regularly lasting approximately 5 minutes and deliver by nurse or physician. Some issues rise in this short session including coexisting diseases, the history of drug use, current disease and advice about the health risks of irregular medication use.</description>

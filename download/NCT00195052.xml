  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is a disease affecting 1-2% of the population. Currently, the only known cure for
      epilepsy is surgery, which is much more effective at eliminating seizures arising from the
      medial temporal lobe compared with the neocortex. The problem with neocortical epilepsy is
      that the population of neurons underlying each epileptiform discharge varies over time. In
      addition, the spatial relationship between interictal events and the ictal onset zones,
      which are critical in defining the region of epileptogenesis, is not well understood and
      essential to the surgical treatment of epilepsy. Electrophysiological recording methods,
      although currently the &quot;gold standard&quot; in mapping epilepsy, are inadequate to address these
      questions based on restrictions due to volume conduction or sampling limitations. Optical
      recording techniques can overcome many of these limitations by sampling large areas of
      cortex simultaneously to provide information about blood flow, metabolism and extracellular
      fluid shifts that are intimately related to excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activity. In
      fact, optical recordings may actually be more sensitive to certain aspects of epileptic
      activity than electrophysiologic recordings. The goal will be to translate these findings
      into the operating room and map human neocortical epilepsy with the same optical techniques.
      Outcome following surgical resections to treat neocortical epilepsy will be correlated with
      the optical maps to determine the utility of intrinsic signal imaging in guiding brain
      surgery. These experiments will set the groundwork for implementing optical recordings in
      general clinical practice as a novel technique for mapping and predicting human seizures.

        The patient, who is going to undergo a neurosurigcal procedure which will require
        intraoperative brain mapping to determine the brain organization, is the potential study
        subject.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this non-dispensing fitting study is to evaluate the subjective comfort, lens
      handling, lens fitting characteristics and visual acuity of different hydrogel lens designs
      versus silicone hydrogel lenses
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 60-subject, double masked, randomized, contra lateral, non-dispensing fitting
      trial comparing different lens materials (hydrogel vs silicone hydrogel). It is anticipated
      that this study will involve 2 visits, for each lens pair, as follows: Visits: V1 (lens
      dispensing), V2 (1 hour post lens settling). Each subject will be randomized to wear the
      test and control lenses in a series of three short fitting comparisons.

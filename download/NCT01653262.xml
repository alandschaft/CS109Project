  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trial N01395 is to evaluate the reduction of nonpsychotic behavioral side effects in
      subjects with Epilepsy who switched to BRV 200 mg/day after discontinuing LEV due to such
      side effects; as well as the efficacy, safety and tolerability of BRV. No statistical
      hypothesis testing will be performed.

    <description>The subjects will be treated with Brivaracetam (BRV) tablets 200 mg/day during 12 weeks: four 25 mg tablets, twice daily.
Based on the Investigator's judgement, at any time, the dose can be decreased to BRV 150 mg/day, 100 mg/day, or 50 mg/day. Flexible dosing, can be up- and down-titrated as needed.
At the end of the Treatment Period, the subject will either enter the N01372 long-term follow-up study or down-titrate during 4 weeks.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject with well-characterized Epilepsy according to the 1989 International League
             Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification

          -  Subject with Epilepsy who the investigator expects will benefit from Levetiracetam
             (LEV) but for whom the investigator has decided to discontinue due to nonpsychotic
             behavioral side effects following the introduction of LEV

          -  Subject is currently receiving LEV at the recommended therapeutic dose (dose ranging
             from 1 g/day to 3 g/day)

          -  Subject currently treated with minimum 2 and maximum 3 Anti-Epileptic Drugs (AEDs)
             including LEV. Vagal Nerve Stimulation (VNS) is allowed and will be counted as a
             concomitant AED

          -  Female subjects without childbearing potential (postmenopausal for at least 2 years,
             bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation, complete hysterectomy) are eligible. Female
             subjects with childbearing potential are eligible if they use a medically accepted
             contraceptive method

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a lifetime history of suicide attempt (including an actual, interrupted
             or aborted attempt), or has had suicidal ideation in the past 6 months as indicated
             by a positive response (&quot;Yes&quot;) to either Question 4 or Question 5 of the
             Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) at Visit 1

          -  Subject whose seizures could not be reliably counted on a regular basis due to their
             fast and repetitive occurrence (clusters or flurries)

          -  Subject has history or presence of status epilepticus during the year preceding Visit
             1 or during Baseline

          -  Subject has history or presence of known psychogenic nonepileptic seizures

          -  Subject has any clinical conditions (eg, bone marrow depression, chronic hepatic
             disease, and/or severe renal impairment) which impair reliable participation in the
             study or necessitate the use of medication not allowed by protocol

          -  Subject is pregnant or lactating

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Relapse remains a principle cause of treatment failure for patients with aggressive lymphoma
      after autologous transplantation. Non-myeloablative allogeneic transplantation allows
      patients to receive an infusion of donor cells in an attempt to induce a graft versus
      lymphoma effect. This study will assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of the
      combination of autologous stem cell transplantation followed by non-myeloablative
      transplantation for patients with poor-risk aggressive lymphoma.

      This is a phase II clinical trial investigating the feasibility, and efficacy of sequential
      autologous stem cell transplant followed by non-myeloablative allogeneic transplant for
      patients with poor risk lymphoma. Patients will be enrolled onto the trial when eligible and
      undergo standard high-dose chemotherapy with the combination with busulfan,
      cyclophosphamide, and etoposide followed by autologous stem cell transplant. After recovery
      of counts and clinical status, patients will then proceed to non-myeloablative allogeneic
      stem cell transplant using a fully matched related or unrelated donor.

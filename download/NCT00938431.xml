  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of LCM syrup in
      children ages 1 month-17 years with uncontrolled partial seizures when added to 1 to 3 other
      antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) seizure medications.

    <textblock>
      Six subjects aged 5-11 will initially be enrolled at the 8 mg/kg/day dose level. Upon
      completion of the trial for these subjects, pharmacokinetic and safety data will be analyzed
      to determine the target dose for the remaining subjects (either 8, 10 or 12 mg/kg/day).
      Depending on the selected target dose, different age-based Cohorts of subjects will be
      enrolled. LCM will be increased 2 mg/kg/day per week until the target dose or maximum dose
      able to be tolerated is achieved.

    <description>For assessment of the Clinical Global Impression of Change, the investigator should provide his/her assessment of the subject's clinical status, compared to Baseline (Visit 1), including an evaluation of seizure frequency and intensity, the occurrence of AEs, and subject's functional status.
The investigator will be asked to check the number that best describes the subject's condition over the past 4 weeks compared to Baseline:
Very much improved

      This is a multicenter, multiple ascending dose, open-label study (Core Study) with an
      Extension Phase. The Core Study consisted of 2 phases, the Pretreatment Phase and the
      Treatment Phase. The Pretreatment Phase lasted up to 2 weeks in duration, during which
      participants were assessed for their eligibility to participate in the study. The Treatment
      Phase consisted of 3 periods: Titration (7 weeks), Maintenance (4 weeks), and Follow-up (4
      weeks; only for those participants not rolling over into the Extension Phase after
      completing the Treatment Phase and for those participants who discontinued from the study).
      The extension phase consists of 41 weeks.

    <measure>Apparent Clearance (CL/F) of Perampanel - for Core Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood samples were collected at day 8, Day 36, Day 64 , and Day 78.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>CL/F was defined as the volume of plasma cleared of the drug per unit time. The CL/F values were calculated for each visit and averaged to derive the total CL/F value per arm. Data was analyzed for 2 categories: CYP3A4/5 inducers (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine and phenytoin) and non-inducers. Data is presented as mean Liter per hour +/-standard deviation.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>C av,ss was calculated as 'Dose (mg)/Dosing Interval (24 h)/(CL/F [L/h]) x 1000'. C av,ss during a dosing interval was dose-normalized to 0.12 mg/kg in participants aged â‰¥ 2 to less than 12 years (intended to correspond to 8 mg/70 kg in adults/adolescents). Data was analysed for 2 categories: CYP3A4/5 inducers (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine and phenytoin) and non-inducers. Data is presented as mean Liter per hour +/- standard deviation.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Seizure Frequency Per 28 Days in Treatment Phase (for Core Study)</measure>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Seizure frequency was derived from information (seizure count and type) recorded in participant diary. The seizure frequency per 28 days was calculated as the number of seizures divided by the number of days in the interval and multiplied by 28. The percent change in 28-day seizure frequency from baseline was assessed for overall seizures, overall partial seizures, overall generalized seizures, and unclassified seizures. The data is presented as mean percent change =/- standard deviation.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Responder rate was defined as the proportion of participants with a 50% decrease in 28-day seizure frequency during the Maintenance Period compared to Baseline [2 weeks Pretreatment Phase (Visit 1) plus 4 Weeks Prior to Pretreatment Phase] for overall seizures, overall partial seizures, overall generalized seizures, and unclassified seizures.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) evaluated perceived seizure frequency and severity, the occurrence of AEs, and overall functional status of the participant. The investigator performed the Clinical Global Impression of Severity for all participants at Baseline (Day 1). The evaluation used a 7-point scale where 1=normal, not at all ill and 7=extremely ill. The investigator performed the Clinical Global Impression of Change for all participants at the end of treatment (Day 78). The evaluation used a 7-point scale where 1=very much improved and 7=very much worse. This tool was used to assess the participant's status over the 4-week period prior to its completion compared to Baseline (Day 1).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Non Serious Adverse Events (AEs) and Treatment Emergent Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability of Perampanel</measure>

    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered an investigational product. A SAE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose resulted in death, was life-threatening (ie, the participant was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred; this did not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death), required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or was as a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in the child of a participant who was exposed to the study drug). In this study, treatment emergent AEs (defined as an AE/SAE that started/increased in severity on/after the first dose of study medication up to 30 days after the final dose of study medication) were assessed. The data is presented in the safety section of the results.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Seizure Frequency Per 28 Days in Treatment Phase (for Core Study)</title>
        <description>Seizure frequency was derived from information (seizure count and type) recorded in participant diary. The seizure frequency per 28 days was calculated as the number of seizures divided by the number of days in the interval and multiplied by 28. The percent change in 28-day seizure frequency from baseline was assessed for overall seizures, overall partial seizures, overall generalized seizures, and unclassified seizures. The data is presented as mean percent change =/- standard deviation.</description>

            <description>Responder rate was defined as the proportion of participants with a 50% decrease in 28-day seizure frequency during the Maintenance Period compared to Baseline [2 weeks Pretreatment Phase (Visit 1) plus 4 Weeks Prior to Pretreatment Phase] for overall seizures, overall partial seizures, overall generalized seizures, and unclassified seizures. The data is presented as percent responders. LOCF = Last Observation Carried Forward.</description>

        <description>The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) evaluated perceived seizure frequency and severity, the occurrence of AEs, and overall functional status of the participant. The investigator performed the Clinical Global Impression of Severity for all participants at Baseline (Day 1). The evaluation used a 7-point scale where 1=normal, not at all ill and 7=extremely ill. The investigator performed the Clinical Global Impression of Change for all participants at the end of treatment (Day 78). The evaluation used a 7-point scale where 1=very much improved and 7=very much worse. This tool was used to assess the participant's status over the 4-week period prior to its completion compared to Baseline (Day 1).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Non Serious Adverse Events (AEs) and Treatment Emergent Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability of Perampanel</title>
        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered an investigational product. A SAE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose resulted in death, was life-threatening (ie, the participant was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred; this did not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death), required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or was as a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in the child of a participant who was exposed to the study drug). In this study, treatment emergent AEs (defined as an AE/SAE that started/increased in severity on/after the first dose of study medication up to 30 days after the final dose of study medication) were assessed. The data is presented in the safety section of the results.</description>

Participants selected their response from one of the five options (very easy, easy, neither easy or difficult, difficult and very difficult).</description>

        <description>C av,ss was calculated as 'Dose (mg)/Dosing Interval (24 h)/(CL/F [L/h]) x 1000'. C av,ss during a dosing interval was dose-normalized to 0.12 mg/kg in participants aged â‰¥ 2 to less than 12 years (intended to correspond to 8 mg/70 kg in adults/adolescents). Data was analysed for 2 categories: CYP3A4/5 inducers (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine and phenytoin) and non-inducers. Data is presented as mean Liter per hour +/- standard deviation.</description>

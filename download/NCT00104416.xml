  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of LAMICTAL (lamotrigine)
      extended-release with placebo in the treatment of Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic (PGTC)
      seizures. LAMICTAL extended-release is an investigational drug. Placebo tablets look like
      LAMICTAL extended-release tablets but do not contain active medication. In this study,
      LAMICTAL extended-release or placebo tablets will be added to current seizure treatments.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The ESS is an 8-item, self-administered questionnaire that measures excessive daytime sleepiness in adults. The instrument captures information on the extent to which the participant would be likely, or not, to fall asleep in certain situations. The stimulus question is: How likely are you to doze off or fall asleep in the following situations, in contrast to feeling just tired? Questions are answered on a 4-point scale (would never doze [0] to high chance of dozing [3]). The total score ranges from 0 to 24, where a higher score indicates a higher chance of dozing.</description>

  <clinical_results>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>All participants (par.) that complete the Treatment Phase (TP) and all Baseline Failures (par. who did not meet randomization seizure criteria necessary to qualify for the TP) are eligible to enter the Continuation Phase (CP). The CP is for long-term safety exposure to lamotrigine (LTG) extended release (XR); it is not a cross-over phase.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The number of par. starting the CP does not equal the number completing the TP, as 1) the CP was optional, 2) not everyone from the TP was eligible to enter the CP, and 3) Baseline Failures were allowed to enter the CP, however they were not included in the “started&quot; count for the TP.</pre_assignment_details>

Baseline Failures were participants that successfully progressed through the Screening Phase and completed the Baseline Phase of the Double-blind Study, but ultimately did not meet the seizure frequency criteria for randomization into the Double-Blind Treatment Phase of the study. As a result, they were not counted as having started in the Double-Blind Study, but were eligible to enter the CP of the study.</description>

        <description>Percent change from baseline is calculated as the number of seizures by week during the Escalation Phase (Treatment Week 1 up to Week 7), the Maintenance Phase (Treatment Week 8 up to Week 19), and during the last 8 weeks of the Maintenance Phase (Treatment Week 12 up to Week 19) compared to the number of seizures per week during the Baseline Phase (Baseline Week 1 up to Week 8). A positive number equals a reduction in seizure frequency.</description>

        <description>The POMS is a self-administered 65-item questionnaire that evaluates the participants' perception of their mood state in 6 areas: tension-anxiety, depression-dejection, anger-hostility, vigor-activity, fatigue-inertia, and confusion-bewilderment. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely), with higher scores indicating a more negative mood state. A total score (from 0 to 24) is obtained by summing the scores of the six domains.</description>

        <description>The 20-item CES-D questionnaire is self-administered and asks respondents to report the frequency to which the 20 events were experienced over the past week. A 4-point Likert scale is used and ranges from rarely or none of the time (0) to most or all of the time (3). The total score, a sum across the 20 items (ranging from 0 to 60), determines the extent to which a participant may be experiencing depression. Higher scores indicate a higher severity of depression.</description>

        <description>The NDDI-E is a self-reported questionnaire composed of 46 brief phrases/words to identify mood disorders across the spectrum of depression. It was developed to capture depressive moods that are co-morbid with the disease of epilepsy or its treatment as well as to measure the depressive state of the participant. All phrases are measured on a 4-point Likert scale of Never (1) to Always/often (4) and refer to the participants’ mood over the past week. Scoring is comprised of a total mood score calculated by summing the scores of 6 specific items (from 6=never to 24=always or often).</description>

            <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory-Epilepsy (NDDI-E) 6-Item Total Score at Week 19 of the Double-Blind Treatment Phase</title>
            <description>The NDDI-E is a self-reported questionnaire composed of 46 brief phrases/words to identify mood disorders across the spectrum of depression. It was developed to capture depressive moods that are co-morbid with the disease of epilepsy or its treatment as well as to measure the depressive state of the participant. All phrases are measured on a 4-point Likert scale of Never (1) to Always/often (4) and refer to the participants’ mood over the past week. Scoring is comprised of a total mood score calculated by summing the scores of 6 specific items (from 6=never to 24=always or often).</description>

        <description>The QOLIE-31 is a 31-item questionnaire that evaluates the participants' perception of his or her quality of life in 7 domains: seizure worry, emotional well being, energy/fatigue, cognitive functioning, medication effects, social functioning, and overall quality of life. Each domain (with scores ranging from 0 to 100) is summed and divided by the total number of questions that were answered. The overall score is derived by weighting and then summing up the seven domain scores.</description>

        <description>The AEP is a list of 19 items covering many possible side effects attributable to drug treatment. The participants respond by assessing how much each event has been a problem for them over the past 4 weeks (1=Never a Problem to 4=Always a Problem). Each individual item can be examined; an overall adverse events score is calculated as the sum of the scores across the 19 items. The AEP total score ranges from 19 to 76, with a higher score indicating a higher degree of adverse event severity.</description>

        <description>The ESS is an 8-item, self-administered questionnaire that measures excessive daytime sleepiness in adults. The instrument captures information on the extent to which the participant would be likely, or not, to fall asleep in certain situations. The stimulus question is: How likely are you to doze off or fall asleep in the following situations, in contrast to feeling just tired? Questions are answered on a 4-point scale (would never doze [0] to high chance of dozing [3]). The total score ranges from 0 to 24, where a higher score indicates a higher chance of dozing.</description>

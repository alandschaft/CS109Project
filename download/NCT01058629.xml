      This is a multicenter study to evaluate the clinical performance of the SynergEyes A2 lens
      in patients with refractive errors with or without astigmatism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hybrid contact lenses have been previously shown to be a safe and effective method to
      correct refractive errors with and without astigmatism. The hybrid contact lens design may
      provide greater visual acuity and comfort than other soft or rigid gas permeable (RGP)
      lenses currently available. The purpose of this study is to confirm the design of the
      SynergEyes A2 lens by evaluating clinical performance and, if necessary, modify certain lens
      parameters in order to optimize lens performance. Objective and subjective parameters will
      be used to evaluate the lens.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For many years, there has been interest in the question of whether a special diet of some
      sort could be used to help control epileptic seizures. The ketogenic diet has been used
      since the 1920s, but it is used only in children, and is nutritionally unbalanced. It is
      typically withdrawn after 3 years. The ketogenic diet unfortunately, offers no long-term
      solution to seizure control.

      Our preliminary research now suggests that there may be a healthy, long-term dietary
      approach to controlling seizures.

      Based on our animal work and published clinical studies the investigators hypothesize that a
      DHA dose of 3 g/day will reduce seizure frequency in patients with intractable seizures.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a small, double-blind study involving placebo and 3 g/day of DHA. There will be
      a one-month baseline period, followed by a six month treatment period. Placebo subjects will
      be offered DHA at the end of the treatment period, if they wish to take it.

        1. Patients will primarily be nominated by the principle Investigator, Dr. Paul Hwang

        2. Patients will be contacted by phone by the study coordinator, who will explain the
           study and ask about willingness to participate. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will
           be discussed, as well as the patient's responsibilities. It will be made clear that
           there will be no cost to the patient.

        3. If patients are interested, a letter will be sent to them. The letter will contain a
           description of the study, the patient's responsibilities if he/she agrees to
           participate, and an explanation of informed consent.

        4. One week after the letter, the study coordinator will again contact the patients by
           phone,, answer any questions, and

           - if the patient is willing to participate - set up the initial (screening) visit.

        5. At the screening visit (visit 1), the study coordinator will review the medial history
           (seizure frequency/type) and medications. The study coordinator will then give the
           subject written and verbal information. Patients will be asked to sign an informed
           consent form. They will be given a seizure diary, to keep during the first month (prior
           to treatment) and to continue for the six months of DHA treatment. The diary will
           record the frequency/type of seizures. (At this point, potential subjects will be
           sorted into placebo, and DHA groups, balanced for different types of seizure).

        6. One month after visit 1, an appointment will be scheduled with Dr. Hwang, who will
           check the patient's health and order blood work related to anticonvulsant drug levels -
           which will be taken on that day (visit 2). About two teaspoons of extra blood will be
           taken and stored for possible future assays. The study coordinator will then provide
           the patients with their appropriate capsules for the first three months of the trial.
           The patient will receive written instructions on how to take the capsules. Only the
           study coordinator will know the patients' group assignments. (A sealed back-up of the
           code will be left with Dr. Burnham.) Patients will be given the study coordinator's
           cell phone number with instructions to call if they feel unwell at any time. If serious
           problems occur, the study coordinator will refer patients to the Emergency Department
           of the North York General Hospital.

        7. One and two months after visit 2, the study coordinator will meet with the patients to
           check their well-being and progress, and to provide them with the next months' supply
           of capsules (visits 3 &amp; 4).

        8. One month later (visit 5), the patient will have another appointment with Dr. Hwang,
           who will check their health and progress, and order blood work. (Two teaspoons of the
           blood will be reserved for possible future assays.) The study coordinator will check
           the seizure diary and provide the next three month's supply of capsules.

        9. One and two months later, the study coordinator will meet with the patients to check on
           their well-being and progress, and to provide them with their next months' supply of
           capsules (visits 6 &amp; 7).

       10. One month later, after the last month of the trial, another appointment will be booked
           with Dr. Hwang (visit 8) who will re-examine the patient, and schedule more blood work.
           (Two teaspoons of the blood will be reserved for possible future assays.) At the end of
           the visit, The study coordinator will debrief the patient and give him/her a letter of
           thanks from the P.I. The patient will then be told where he/she can purchase DHA if
           he/she wants to continue.

       11. Data will be analyzed by Drs. Thompson and Burnham. After data analysis, patients will
           be informed about the results of the whole by letter.

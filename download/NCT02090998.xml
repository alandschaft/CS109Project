  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare a local anesthetic technique that has been used to treat subjects
      suffering from transformed migraines (chronic migraines) versus medical management with
      traditional antidepressant Amitriptyline / Elavil.

      Subjects will be randomized into one of two treatment groups to compare the safety and
      efficacy of the therapies. Subjects will recieve either sphenopalatine ganglion nerve block
      with 5% lidocaine gel into the nasopharynx or medical management with traditional
      antidepressants, Elavil, to produce a reduction in the frequency and severity of the
      headache.

      We propose that there will be a difference in the outcomes when comparing the two methods of
      treating transformed migraines and that one research arm will result in more patient
      satisfaction and greater efficacy in the treatment of subjects

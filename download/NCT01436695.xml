  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is a syndrome of episodic brain dysfunction characterized by recurrent seemingly
      unpredictable spontaneous seizures. The occurrence of the seizure in patients without any
      forewarning is the most debilitating aspect of the disease.

      The Epicall system is intended for early detection of seizure related life threatening
      events by monitoring per-seizures biomarkers. The system is based on a sticker placed on the
      side of the face. The external sticker incorporates EOG (electrooculograph electrode) and
      PPG (photoplethysmograph electrode) sensors for continuous monitoring of:

        1. Heart Rate (base line, increase, decrease, asystole).

        2. Extra ocular eye movement (blinking, eye deviation, roving eye movements).

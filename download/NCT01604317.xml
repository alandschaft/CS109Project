  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall hypothesis is that plastic bags used in combination with WHO thermoregulation
      care will reduce the incidence of hypothermia in preterm/low birth weight and full term
      infants when compared to routine WHO thermoregulation care alone. Part I is for preterm/low
      birth weight infant with or without plastic head cover used during resuscitation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the incidence of hypothermia during the first hour after birth in
      preterm/low birth weight infants randomized to receive WHO thermoregulation care and a
      plastic bag (without drying) covering the torso and lower extremities (control group) or WHO
      thermoregulation care and a plastic bag (without drying) covering the torso, upper and lower
      extremities, and a portion of their head (intervention group). The axillary temperature of
      each infant will be taken initially within 15 minutes of birth and later at 1 hour after
      birth as the infant is removed from the plastic bag. Seizures, hyperthermia, room
      temperature, and death will be recorded throughout the hospitalization for all infants. With
      an estimated baseline hypothermia rate of 41% and a 21% absolute risk reduction (51%
      relative risk reduction), a sample size of 182 will be used to have a power of 80% and a
      confidence interval of 95%.

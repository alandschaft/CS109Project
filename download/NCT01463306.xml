      Study A0081106 is a 12-month open-label study to evaluate the long term safety and
      tolerability of pregabalin as add-on therapy in pediatric subjects 1 month to 16 years of
      age with partial onset seizures and pediatric and adult subjects 5 to 65 years of age with
      primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Pregabalin will be administered in equally
      divided daily doses for 1 year, in either capsule or liquid oral formulation.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dexmedetomidine is an alpha-2 agonist commonly used during neurosurgery due to its unique
      properties as a sedative and anxiolytic with minimal respiratory depression. Neurosurgical
      patients frequently come to the operating room on anticonvulsant therapy with a history of
      seizures. The investigators clinical experience suggests that these patients are resistant
      to the sedative effects of dexmedetomidine. This effect may represent a pharmacokinetic
      interaction between the anticonvulsant medications and dexmedetomidine or the higher
      dexmedetomidine dose requirement could result from abnormal pharmacodynamics due to the
      underlying seizure disorder. The investigators study aims to investigate the pharmacokinetic
      and pharmacodynamic differences of dexmedetomidine between patients receiving and not
      receiving enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant therapy and to identify a potential mechanism for
      these differences.

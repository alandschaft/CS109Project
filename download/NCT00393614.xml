  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In clinical practice at the National centre for epilepsy (SSE) in Norway we see many
      children who have subclinical epileptiform activity in EEG that increases substantially
      during slow wave sleep (SSEA; subclinical sleep-activated epileptiform activity). They may
      or may not have seizures. Hence, according to the definition some children with SSEA do not
      suffer from epilepsy because they do not experience seizures. Many of these children have
      symptoms such as: attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (AD/HD), dyslectic problems,
      sleep problems, tantrums or autistic symptoms . We hypothesize that this subclinical
      epileptiform activity during slow sleep may act negatively on cognitive functions, language
      and behaviour in some children; even when the spike-wave discharges are less frequent than
      in CSWS (continuous spike-waves during slow sleep).

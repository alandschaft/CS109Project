      The purpose of this study is

        1. To describe patient characteristics and drug usage among children that are prescribed
           esomeprazole for the first time and to compare them with patients who are prescribed
           other proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2-receptor antagonists for the first time.

        2. To ascertain all incident hospitalized cases of angioneurotic oedema, pneumonia,
           gastroenteritis, failure to thrive, convulsions/seizures, acute interstitial nephritis
           and thrombocytopenia among new users in the three cohorts of esomeprazole, other PPIs
           and H2-receptor antagonists.

        The study population will include all children aged 0 to 18 years receiving a first
        dispension of acid suppressing drugs recorded in the PHARMO RLS database between September
        2008 and October 2011. Subjects will be followed-up for at least 18 month. First review of
        study outcomes including chart reviews is estimated to start in August 2011.

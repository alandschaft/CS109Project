  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to check whether an early adjustment of the Air-Limb prosthesis to
      Transtibial amputees due to vascular diseases, will shorten the healing time of the stump
      and the process of rehabilitation.

    <textblock>
      The method of immediate adjustment of a temporary Prosthesis has been developed in the past,
      aiming to reduce the healing time of the stump and the process of rehabilitation. According
      to this method, a temporary Prosthesis is being adjusted immediately after amputation, or
      during the first week after it. Rehabilitation starts with the patient's standing while
      partial weight bearing on the Prosthesis.

      In spite of many experiments and trials to adopt this process of rehabilitation, it is not
      universally adopted, because of the bad adjustment and damages to the stump caused by the
      Plaster of Paris. At present, with the improvement of materials and research experiments are
      being renewed, to check the efficiency of the process, using the Air- Limb a temporary
      Prosthesis.

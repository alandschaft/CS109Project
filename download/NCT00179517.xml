  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment using a medication (Arimidex), which
      lowers estrogen levels in the blood is better than placebo, a tablet that does not contain
      any active medication, when combined with testosterone replacement to treat reproductive and
      sexual dysfunction in men with epilepsy. Arimidex, the medication that is currently under
      study, does not, at this time, have FDA approval for use for this indication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a three-month study where baseline information is collected at the first visit and
      then each patient is started on treatment with testosterone supplementation and either
      Arimidex or placebo. Lab tests, seizure frequency, sexual function and mood will be
      monitored on a monthly basis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be a male between the ages of 18 and 50 years.

          -  Subject must have localization-related epilepsy with complex partial and/or secondary
             generalized seizures.

          -  Subject will meet criteria for hypogonadism (abnormally low bioactive testosterone
             levels and abnormally low scores on questionnaires of reproductive and sexual
             function).

          -  Subject will have had a normal urogenital and rectal/prostate exam during the year
             prior to entry.

          -  Subject will have had documentation of therapeutic range serum AED levels, a normal
             CBC, and hepatic enzyme (ALT,AST, alkaline phosphatase) levels that are less than
             twofold elevated during the 6 months prior to entry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject that has taken hormones, major tranquilizers or antidepressants in the three
             months prior to entry.

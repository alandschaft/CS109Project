  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with seizure disorder face unique challenges during the perioperative period.
      Fasting, sleep-deprivation, and missed doses of medications while patients are required to
      have nothing per mouth (NPO) are a few factors that decrease the seizure threshold. The
      incidence of seizures in this population is unknown but correlated with patient's underlying
      condition and missed doses of anti-convulsant. Previous work has determined this is not a
      unique problem.

      The investigators initially found compliance extremely poor at 60%. The investigators have
      made improvement to about 80% compliance through various interventions: education of
      nursing, availability of anticonvulsant intravenous dosing alternatives, and re-wording the
      hospital NPO policy. The investigators feel that a new, more focused, survey will help
      identify, perioperative reasons for non-compliance on part of the parents. This information
      will be utilized to guide further interventions aimed at improving compliance.

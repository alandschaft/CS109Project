  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A national context for patient centered care development exists in France at hospital with
      strong support for the implementation of operational patient centered care tools. Patient
      centered care is a global vision of patient or family management promoting the respect of
      patient freedom, of patient listening and of patient needs. Patient centered care is an
      important issue of quality and security of care. The FORAP (Fédération des Organismes
      Régionaux et territoriaux pour l'Amélioration des Pratiques et des organisations) and the la
      HAS (High Authority of Health) have developed and validated five tools promoting patient
      centered care at hospital.

      They can be implemented one by one or in association according to hospital situation.
      Hospitals should identify the association of tools fitting the most to their objectives and
      the actions already done.

      The objectives of the project are to analyse the effectiveness of the implementation of HAS
      - FORAP tools on the development of patient centred care at hospital and to analyse the
      individual and organisational determinants of their effectiveness. It focuses on acute care
      hospitals that have the choice of the combination of tools and that are followed during two
      years with combined quantitative and qualitative analyses. Quantitative assessment are based
      on validated indicators on patient satisfaction, patient centred care development and
      organizational context. Qualitative data collection are realised in each included hospital
      and combine individual interviews and focus groups including Physicians, nurses and
      managerial staff.

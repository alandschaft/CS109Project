      Summary:

        -  A few studies have explored the effects of providing parents with health information
           about their children. However, more information is needed about the relationship
           between awareness of health information and changes in behavior. This study will
           investigate the impact of health information on choices that mothers make about food
           for their children.

        -  Mothers with a biological child between the ages of 4-5 years old may be eligible for
           this study. Participants are recruited from the Washington, DC metropolitan area.

        -  In this study, before visiting the research center, participants will answer online
           questionnaires about their children's health and eating habits and their own health and
           eating habits.

        -  At the research center, participants will use a virtual reality model of a buffet to
           make food choices for their children. Participants will be introduced to the
           computer-based virtual buffet scenario as a training session to prepare for using the
           buffet during the experimental context. While in the virtual environment, participants
           wear a video helmet that allows them to see the virtual buffet scenario.

        -  After the training session, participants will watch an interactive computer
           presentation about a health topic.

        -  Participants will then visit the virtual buffet scenario again for the formal session,
           and will choose a virtual lunch meal for their child as before.

        -  At the end of their visit, participants will complete post-test questionnaires about
           their experiences during the experiment and other research-related information.

        -  The total time for the study is approximately 90 minutes. The participants children
           will not be asked to take part in the study.

      Eligibility:

      - Women at least 18 years of age who have a biological child between the ages of 4 and 5 who
      has no major food allergies or diet-related health conditions, developmental delays, or
      disabilities. You may not take part in the study if you have a history of seizures and/or
      are pregnant.

      Purpose

      This study will investigate the impact of health information on choices that mothers make
      about food for their children. Mothers will use a virtual reality model of a buffet to make
      food choices.

      Mothers with a biological child between the ages of 4-5 years old may be eligible for this
      study. Participants are recruited from the Washington, DC metropolitan area.

      Study participants will complete two sets of surveys and one task. Participants will
      complete a web-based survey before coming in for a study appointment. When participants
      arrive for their appointment, they will watch an interactive presentation on health
      information. Next, participants will interact in a virtual environment and will be asked to
      select virtual lunch for their child from a buffet. While in the virtual environment, a
      participant wears a head-mounted video unit that allows her to see elements of the
      environment. Finally, participants will complete an additional computer-based survey. The
      total time for the study is approximately 90 minutes. The participants children will not be
      asked to take part in the study.

      Detailed Description

      This study will investigate issues around the impact of health information on choices that
      mothers make about food for their children. Participants will perform tasks that include
      completing computer-based surveys, watching an interactive computer-based presentation about
      health information, participating in a virtual reality model by selecting virtual lunch for
      their children from a buffet, and completing a computed-based exit survey. As part of the
      study, participants will wear a virtual reality helmet and be immersed in a buffet where
      they will select virtual lunch for their child.

      For this study, we are only recruiting women that have a biological child between the ages
      of 4-5 years old. You may not take part in the study if you have a history of seizures
      and/or are pregnant.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has unparalleled efficacy in treating severe depression that
      is resistant to common modalities of treatment, such as antidepressant medication. Although
      treatment with ECT has benefited many individuals with treatment resistant depression (rates
      as high as 50-75%), its more widespread use is hindered by the social stigma associated with
      the treatment, as well as by its significant cognitive side effects. Moreover, ECT cannot be
      precisely targeted, since it produces a widespread activation of the brain surface, in turn,
      affecting many different functional areas. Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is currently being
      investigated as an alternative to ECT, as it is more focused to one area of the brain.
      Rather than applying electrical stimuli to induce a seizure, as is done in ECT, MST uses
      repetitive magnetic stimulation to produce the seizure. Preliminary research suggests that
      MST can result in therapeutic effects comparable to those produced by ECT, but without the
      negative side effects on cognition. The proposed study is a randomized, controlled trial, in
      which the efficacy and side effect profile of MST will be compared to those of ECT. If
      successful, the results of this study may lead to increased treatment availability and
      accessibility, as well as lessen the substantial health care costs associated with treatment
      resistant depression.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  inpatients or outpatients

          -  voluntary and competent to consent to treatment

          -  DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder, single or recurrent, without psychotic
             features

          -  have failed to achieve a clinical response to adequate treatment trials of at least
             two antidepressants (with adequacy established according to a predefined criterion on
             the Antidepressant Treatment History Form (ATHF)) or have been unable to tolerate at
             least two antidepressants

          -  have a baseline HRSD-24 score â‰¥ 21

          -  are considered to be appropriate to receive ECT as assessed by an ECT attending
             psychiatrist and an anaesthesiologist

          -  are agreeable to keeping their current antidepressant treatment constant through the
             duration of the study

          -  are able to adhere to the intervention schedule

          -  meet the MST safety criteria

          -  are on a medically acceptable form of birth control if a woman of child-bearing
             potential

          -  are a resident of Canada

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  have a history of DSM-IV substance dependence or abuse within the past three months

          -  have a concomitant major unstable medical illness

             investigator

          -  have possible or probable dementia

          -  have failed a course of ECT within the current depressive episode

          -  have any significant neurological disorder or condition likely to be associated with
             increased intracranial pressure or cognitive impairment (e.g., a space occupying
             brain lesion, a history of stroke, a cerebral aneurysm, a seizure disorder,
             Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, multiple sclerosis, head trauma with loss
             of consciousness for greater than or equal to five minutes)

          -  present with a medical condition, a medication, or a laboratory abnormality that

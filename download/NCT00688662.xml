      The Evaluating Predictors &amp; Interventions in Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction(SOD) study
      (EPISOD) is a randomized sham-controlled study of biliary and pancreatic sphincterotomy as
      treatment for patients with pain after cholecystectomy fitting the criteria for sphincterof
      Oddi dysfuntion type III

      Clinical Trial Phase: Phase III

      Study Sites Seven clinical centers in US

      Study Period Planned enrollment period - 3 years

      Planned duration of the study - 5 years

      Study Population SOD III Patients

      Primary Study Objective: To ascertain whether subjects with SOD III respond to
      sphincterotomy,

      Secondary Study Objectives

      To evaluate:

        -  the association between the results of Sphincter of Oddi Manometry (SOM)
           (abnormal/normal) and the primary outcome (success/failure);

        -  the success rate (as defined in the primary) of subjects who receive biliary
           sphincterotomy alone versus subjects who receive both biliary and pancreatic
           sphincterotomy in the subgroup of patients with manometrically proven hypertension of
           the pancreatic sphincter;

        -  the effects of pre-specified prognostic factors on the primary outcome;

        -  anxiety and depression scores over time and their relation to study outcomes;

        -  the economic impact of SOD III, and of endoscopic sphincterotomy in patients with SOD
           III; and, to,

        -  conduct a careful follow-up study (EPISOD2) of standard of care treatment (separate
           protocol).

      Study Design The EPISOD Trial is a parallel, randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled,
      multicenter Phase III clinical trial of endoscopic sphincterotomy as treatment for adults 18
      to 65 years of age diagnosed with SOD III.

      Sample Size A minimum of 214 subjects will be randomized using a 2:1 allocation in favor of
      sphincterotomy and will be followed for 12 months post-randomization.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients diagnosed with the clinical syndrome of SOD, as defined by the Modified
             Functional Biliary Disorders Module of the Rome III criteria

          2. Pain burden of Grade 3 or higher on RAPID Questionnaire.

          3. Cholecystectomy more than 90 days before enrollment.

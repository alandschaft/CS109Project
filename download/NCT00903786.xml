             trial-related activities.

          2. Patients who participated in Study 231 and completed the required evaluation period
             (10 weeks).

          3. Patients who are certainly and voluntarily able to participate in this study and
             record their seizures by themselves or have family members or caregivers (or nurses,
             if hospitalized) record the seizures. Patients who wish to continue perampanel
             treatment and necessitate receiving the long- term administration judged by the
             investigator or sub-investigator.

        Exclusion criteria:

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to follow patients with partial onset seizures prospectively
      over 5 years in the real-world environment to gather data on the long-term safety and
      effectiveness of the RNS System at qualified CECs by qualified neurologists,
      epileptologists, and neurosurgeons trained on the RNS System.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NeuroPace, Inc. is sponsoring a post-approval study (PAS) of the RNS System device. The RNS
      System is the first FDA-approved closed loop responsive neurostimulator designed to reduce
      the frequency of seizures in individuals with partial onset seizures.

      The RNS System Epilepsy PAS is a 5 year, non-randomized, open-label, multi-center
      prospective observational study. Data regarding safety and efficacy are collected at
      enrollment and periodically throughout the 5-year study.

      The study is designed to assess the long-term safety and effectiveness of the RNS System as
      an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of seizures in individuals 18 years of age
      or older with partial onset seizures who have undergone diagnostic testing that localized no
      more than 2 epileptogenic foci, are refractory to two or more antiepileptic medications, and
      currently have frequent and disabling seizures (motor partial seizures, complex partial
      seizures and/or secondarily generalized seizures).

      Data from the RNS System Epilepsy PAS will be used to calculate long-term SAE rates, median
      percent change in seizure frequency (from pre-implant retrospective data), as well as other
      safety and effectiveness endpoints.

    <description>The RNS System provides closed loop responsive brain stimulation. In response to detection of previously identified electrocorticographic activity, the neurostimulator delivers stimulation to the seizure foci by way of the leads to interrupt the activity before the patient experiences clinical seizures. The typical patient is treated with a cumulative total of 5 minutes of stimulation a day.</description>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to characterize high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in intracranial
      recordings, which may occur as markers of epileptogenic tissue and also under physiological
      stimulation.

      The investigators want to show that recording of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) is
      feasible in our project population both intraoperatively and during presurgical
      physiological conditions.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research is to determine if the biological fluids (blood/saliva) from
      chronic brain-injured patients (both blast and non-penetrating TBI) contain reproducible
      protein markers. To accomplish this two populations of chronic TBI patients who are
      receiving treatment at The Institute for Research and Rehabilitation (TIRR): blast injury
      victims and non-penetrating TBI will be studied. Using multiple proteomic approaches
      including mass spectrometry, multiplex ELISAs, and antibody microarrays, as well as RNA
      profiling, the investigators aim to identify biomarkers in the blood/saliva of patients
      suffering from chronic TBI and to determine the similarities/differences between the blast
      and non-penetrating injury groups. Identification of these biochemical changes will give
      insight into the long-lasting changes associated with head injury, and may identify new
      targets for treating the associated pathologies.

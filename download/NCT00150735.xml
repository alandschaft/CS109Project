      A double-blind trial comparing the efficacy and safety of levetiracetam to carbamazepine
      used as monotherapy in subjects (≥ 16 years) newly or recently diagnosed as suffering from
      epilepsy, and experiencing partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with newly or recently diagnosed epilepsy having experienced unprovoked
             partial seizures (IA, IB, IC with clear focal origin), or generalized tonic-clonic
             seizures (without clear focal origin), that are classifiable according to the
             International Classification of Epileptic Seizures. The discrimination between IC and
             IIE is not requested for inclusion.

          -  Subjects with at least 2 unprovoked seizures separated by a minimum of 48 hours in
             the year preceding randomization out of which at least 1 unprovoked seizure in the 3
             months preceding randomization.

          -  Subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy.

          -  Male/female subjects (≥16 years).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or presence of seizures of other types than partial (IA, IB, IC, with clear
             focal origin) and generalized tonic-clonic (without clear focal origin) seizures.

          -  History or presence of seizures occurring only in clustered patterns, defined as
             repeated seizures occurring over a short period of time, i.e. &lt; 20 minutes, with or
             without function regained between 2 ictal events.

          -  History, clinical or EEG finding suggestive of idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE)
             at randomization.

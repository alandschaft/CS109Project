      To investigate the potential antiepileptic effects of cannabidiol (GWP42003-P) in children

    <textblock>
      This study is a 1:1:1 randomized, double-blind, 14-week comparison of two Dose Levels of
      GWP42003-P versus placebo. A 28-day screening period prior to randomization (to establish
      baseline parameters) will precede the treatment period, which will consist of a two-week
      titration period followed by a 12-week maintenance period. The study will aim to determine
      the efficacy, safety and tolerability of GWP42003-P compared with placebo. The High Dose
      Level will be as recommended by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) after assessment
      of safety and pharmacokinetic data from Part A of study GWEP1332. The Low Dose Level will be
      defined as 50% of the High Dose Level. The first subject will not enroll into this study
      until the DSMC has reviewed the safety data from Part A of study GWEP1332.

      Following study completion, all subjects will be invited to continue to receive GWP42003-P
      in an open label extension (OLE) study (under a separate protocol).

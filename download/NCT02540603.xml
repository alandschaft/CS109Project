  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation is designed to evaluate the performance (leak and comfort) as well as
      participant's overall acceptance of the investigative full face mask amongst OSA
      participants.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total number of up to 15 OSA participants who currently use full face masks will be
      recruited for the trial. Participants will be on the trial for three weeks, using the
      prototypes at home for two weeks. PAP baseline data on the participant's prescribed
      treatment pressure with their usual mask and will be collected for one week prior to mask
      fitting with the full face trial mask.

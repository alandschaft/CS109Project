  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of repetitive TMS (rTMS)
      delivered simultaneously with elements of cognitive behavioral therapy/exposure-response
      prevention (CBT/ERP) in adult subjects (greater or equal to 18 years old) with
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This is an open label study that involves standard of
      care for OCD (CBT) and an investigational treatment modality (TMS). The investigators will
      compare the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) scores before and after treatment
      to quantify clinical improvement. The side effects from TMS include, but are not limited to,
      headache, seizure, and general pain. CBT has minimal side effects other than mental
      discomfort during the exposure sessions. For safety concerns, pregnant women and subjects
      with seizure-related history will be excluded as well as other indicated conditions in the
      details protocol.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to qualify for enrollment into
        the study:

          1. All subjects will be 18 - 65 years of age.

          2. Obsessive-compulsive disorder:

               -  Subjects will meet the DSM-IV primary diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive

               -  Y-BOCS total score &gt; 16

          3. Subjects are willing and able to adhere to the intensive treatment schedule and all
             required study visits.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Subjects will be excluded from study participation if one of the following exclusion
        criteria applies:

          1. Subjects are unable or unwilling to give informed consent.

          2. No exclusion criteria for comorbid DSM diagnosis.

          3. Subjects with a clinically defined neurological disorder that caused significant
             safety concern to receive TMS treatment, including, but not limited to:

               -  Any condition likely to be associated with increased intracranial pressure.

               -  Space occupying brain lesion.

               -  Any history of seizure EXCEPT those therapeutically induced by ECT (childhood
                  febrile seizures are acceptable and these subjects may be included in the
                  study).

               -  History of stroke.

               -  Transient ischemic attack within two years.

               -  Cerebral aneurysm.

               -  Dementia.

               -  Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE-2) score of &lt;24.

               -  Parkinson's disease.

               -  Huntington's disease.

               -  Multiple sclerosis.

               -  Increased risk of seizure for any reason, including prior diagnosis of increased
                  intracranial pressure (such as after large infarctions or trauma), or currently
                  taking medication that lowers the seizure threshold. Medications that lower the
                  seizure threshold are included in the Prohibited Concomitant Medication (Section
                  5.8).

          4. Subjects with any of the following treatment histories:

               -  TMS treatment within 6 months prior to the screening visit.

               -  Lifetime history of treatment with Deep Brain Stimulation

               -  Use of any investigational drug or device within 4 weeks of the randomization
                  visit.

               -  If participating in psychotherapy, must have been in stable treatment for at
                  least 2 months prior to entry into the study, with no anticipation of change in
                  the frequency of therapeutic sessions, or the therapeutic focus over the
                  duration of the trial.

               -  Recent 2-month medication changes

          5. Contraindication to receive TMS:

               -  Cardiac pacemakers, implanted medication pumps, intracardiac lines, or acute,
                  unstable cardiac disease.

               -  Intracranial implant (e.g., aneurysm clips, shunts, stimulators, cochlear
                  implants, stents, or electrodes) or any other metal object within or near the
                  head, excluding the mouth, which cannot be safely removed.

               -  Clinically significant abnormality or clinically significant unstable medical
                  condition, as indicated by medical history, physical examination, ECG results,
                  or clinical laboratory testing, that in the Investigator's judgment might pose a
                  potential safety risk to the subject or limit interpretation of the trial
                  results, e.g., any uncontrolled thyroid disorders, hepatic, cardiac, pulmonary
                  and renal malfunctioning.

          6. Women who are currently pregnant or not using a medically acceptable means of birth
             control and women who are breastfeeding.

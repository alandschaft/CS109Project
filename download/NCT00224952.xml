      The purpose of the study is to examine the individual metabolic profiles of pediatric
      patients receiving carbamazepine or valproate therapy, in an attempt to determine identities
      of the reactive metabolites or, alternatively, the identities of those metabolites that
      serve as potential precursors to reactive species.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adverse drug reactions can be broadly defined as any undesirable response associated with
      therapeutic drug use. A simple and clinically useful classification is to divide adverse
      events into those that are dose-dependent and largely predictable from the known
      pharmacologic properties of the compound in question, and those that are dependent on
      characteristics unique to susceptible individuals, or idiosyncratic in nature.

      The long term objective of this research is to characterize the mechanisms responsible for
      the pathogenesis of idiosyncratic hypersensitivity reactions in children, particularly those
      involving carbamazepine and other aromatic anticonvulsants.

      The study is divided into two phases. Phase 1 of the study involves collecting urine from 50
      patients taking CBZ therapeutically. Participants will be asked to provide a spot urine
      sample during routine health visits. The urine will be analyzed for the presence of CBZ and
      its metabolites. In Phase 2 of the study, urine will be collected from patients taking
      either CBZ or VPA therapeutically. If blood samples are drawn from these patients for
      medical purposes not related to this study the residual blood sample will be recovered
      before it is discarded for use in genotyping analysis. Participants will be asked to provide
      a urine sample covering one complete dosing interval of CBZ or VPA (preferably overnight).
      Patients will also be followed longitudinally, with urine collections at each clinic visit
      over at least a two year period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pediatric patients of both genders between 1 and 16 years of age receiving CBZ or VPA
             mono-therapy will be recruited for this study. Additionally, for those patients who
             are receiving drugs other than CBZ or VPA to control their seizures, if CBZ or VPA
             are subsequently added to their treatment regimen, then these patients will also be
             recruited for this study.

    <textblock>
      This trial consists of 2 parts: a double-blinded phase and an open-label extension phase.
      The open-label extension phase only will be described in this record. All participants will
      receive the same dose of GWP42003-P. However, investigators may subsequently decrease or
      increase the participant's dose until the optimal dose is found.

    <description>Administered orally, twice daily (morning and evening; immediately after the participant's clobazam dose), commencing with titration of 100 mg/mL GWP42003-P to 20 mg/kg/day over 10 days in a blinded manner.
Participants remain on the maintenance dose for the remainder of the 12-month treatment period. However, investigators may subsequently decrease or increase the participant's dose (to a maximum of 30 mg/kg/day) until the optimum dose is found.
Dosing is tapered (10% each day) for participants who do not immediately continue to use GWP42003-P once market authorization is granted, or for those who withdraw early.</description>

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant must have epilepsy, as determined by the investigator, and be taking
             clobazam (CLB).

          -  Participant must have a documented magnetic resonance imaging/computerized tomography
             of the brain ruling out a progressive neurologic condition.

          -  Participant must be taking CLB and no more than 2 other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)
             during the course of the trial.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has clinically significant unstable medical conditions other than epilepsy.

          -  Participants on CLB at doses above 20 mg per day.

          -  Participants taking CLB intermittently as rescue medication.

          -  Participant has a history of symptoms related to a drop in blood pressure due to
             postural changes (e.g., dizziness, light-headedness, blurred vision, palpitations,
             weakness, syncope).

          -  Participant has any history of suicidal behavior or any suicidal ideation of type 4
             or 5 on the C-SSRS in the last month or at the screening visit of the blinded phase
             of the trial.

          -  Participant has had clinically relevant symptoms or a clinically significant illness
             in the 4 weeks prior to screening or enrollment in the blinded phase of the trial,
             other than epilepsy.

          -  Participant is currently using or has in the past used recreational or medicinal
             cannabis, or synthetic cannabinoid-based medications (including SativexÂ®) within the
             3 months prior to trial entry.

          -  Participant has any known or suspected history of any drug abuse or addiction.

          -  Participant is unwilling to abstain from recreational or medicinal cannabis, or
             synthetic cannabinoid based medications (including Sativex) for the duration for the
             trial.

          -  Participant has any known or suspected hypersensitivity to cannabinoids or any of the
             excipients of the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP), e.g., sesame oil.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of infants with medications after their seizures have stopped is very
      variable. No one knows if continuing treatment with phenobarbital for up to several months
      is helpful or harmful. This clinical trial is designed to help answer that question and
      provide data that will help determine standard of care for these children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of infants with antiepileptic medications after the resolution of neonatal
      seizures is highly variable and controversial. Infants are commonly treated with
      phenobarbital after their seizures have resolved to prevent recurrence. Data to support this
      practice are lacking but animal models suggest that the neonatal brain is vulnerable to
      repeated seizures. Yet exposure of the developing brain to phenobarbital for prolonged
      periods may have deleterious consequences. We are proposing a multi-center, randomized,
      clinical trial (RCT) to determine if continued treatment with phenobarbital reduces seizure
      recurrence without adversely affecting neurodevelopmental outcome or if infants' outcomes
      are improved if no prophylactic medication is given. We will identify infants with seizures
      beginning in the first week that resolve within 7 days and randomize them to receive
      phenobarbital or placebo daily for four months. Via visits and frequent telephone contacts
      over the first six months, we will determine the rate of seizure recurrence. The primary
      outcome, neurodevelopmental status, will be assessed at 18-22 months using the Bayley Scales
      of Infant Development. Additional subgroup analyses are planned to determine the
      contribution of seizure etiology to outcome and predictive value of initial EEG
      classification. The trial will be conducted at 18 - 20 sites, chosen for their experience
      and proven track record for enrollment and retention in this specific population. The trial
      will be coordinated by the Clinical Trials Coordination Center at the University of
      Rochester and overseen by a Steering Committee composed of experienced trialists
      representing neonatology and pediatric neurology, biostatistics, and clinical trial
      administration.

      Extrapolation from the results of an RCT of phenobarbital prophylaxis after febrile seizures
      in children suggests that phenobarbital may adversely affect brain development and may be
      ineffective in preventing seizures. Based on this previous RCT that resulted in near
      universal change in practice (the elimination of prolonged use of phenobarbital after simple
      febrile seizures), we anticipate that the data we generate may have a similar impact on
      standard of care for infants with neonatal seizures.

    <description>The Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) measure the mental and motor development and test the behavior of infants from one to 42 months of age. The test is intended to measure a child's level of development in three domains: cognitive, motor, and behavioral. We propose to use mental development as the primary outcome for this trial.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Birth at &gt; 34 weeks' gestation

          -  Neonatal seizures (clinical, electrographic or both), with onset in the first 120
             hours after birth and resolution within 7 days of onset

          -  Parental informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Birth at &lt; 34 weeks' gestation

          -  If the attending neonatologist attributes the seizures solely to a transient
             abnormality, easily correctable and unlikely to recur (eg, transient electrolyte
             abnormalities). If the attending neonatologist cannot be contacted, the site PI will
             be asked to review the available information and judge whether the infant is
             eligible.

          -  If the infant has been diagnosed with or there is a strong suspicion of an inborn
             error of metabolism, significant brain malformation, microcephaly (&lt; 3 %ile), or a
             chromosomal abnormality which, in the absence of seizures, is known to be
             independently associated with an increased likelihood of cognitive impairment

          -  If the infant has been diagnosed with an intrauterine viral infection

          -  If the infant is not expected to survive to discharge

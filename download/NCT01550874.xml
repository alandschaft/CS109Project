  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that a pedometer-based motivated 6-months walking
      program will result in sustainable enhanced PA.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enhanced PA will in turn positively influence health, social participation and QoL of
      sedentary CWE through multiple pathways. These will involve biomedical factors (i.e.
      attention deficit, depression, anxiety and sleep disorders); and contextual environmental
      and personal factors that include psychosocial factors at the child, family and community
      level (Figure 1).21 These factors may include family stressors, social support,
      self-efficacy, and autonomy.22 We expect that enhanced, sustained PA will improve health,
      functioning and QoL of CWE through its potential neuroprotective and circadian rhythm
      regulatory effects, and by increasing social participation, promoting a positive outlook on
      life and self-image, decreasing worries and concerns, decreasing emotional problems and the
      concealment of epilepsy, and delaying secondary health complications.

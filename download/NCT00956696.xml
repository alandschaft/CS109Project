  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been estimated that 22 - 32% of people with mental retardation or learning disability
      have co-existing epilepsy. Despite such high prevalence and although there may be particular
      concerns over the effects of treatment on behaviour and cognition in this population, few
      studies have specifically addressed these concerns. Topiramate (TPM) is one of the modern
      antiepileptic drugs that has been approved for the treatment of a broad range of seizure
      types in both children and adults. There is evidence of associated improvement in behaviour
      with treatment but data is conflicting. The investigators aim to further study the effect of
      TPM on seizure control and behaviour using the Scales of Independent Behavior-Revised
      (SIB-R) which has been applied in similar patient populations and is widely adopted locally
      to assess the behaviour of people with mental retardation. This is a naturalistic, open
      label, single arm prospective study of 16-week in duration. Eligible adult patients will be
      initiated on TPM. Patients will be evaluated at baseline, end of weeks 4, 10 and 16. At each
      visit seizure control and any adverse events will be assessed. Behaviour will be assessed
      using SIB-R (Chinese version) at baseline and each study visit. At the end of the study
      period the patient's overall improvement will be rated by the investigator and the caregiver
      using global evaluation scales. Patients with improvement will be maintained on TPM after
      the end of the study period Titration schedule Topiramate will be administered orally as per
      usual clinical practice. Treatment will be initiated at 25 mg daily for 1 week, and
      increased in 25- to 50-mg increments at one- to two-weekly intervals, to an initial target
      dose of 100 - 200 mg daily in 2 divided doses according to each individual's response.
      Further dose adjustment can be made in response to further seizures or emergence of adverse
      events..

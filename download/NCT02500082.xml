    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether triheptanoin (UX007) is effective in the
      treatment of neurological symptoms related to citrate transporter deficiency (SLC13A5 gene
      mutation).

    <textblock>
      This compassionate use research study has been developed to study an investigational drug,
      triheptanoin (UX007), for the treatment of neurological symptoms related to citrate
      transporter deficiency, a disease with no existing treatment. The hypothesis is that
      triheptanoin will restore deficient energy metabolism in these patients, leading to improved
      seizure control, mental clarity, and physical strength.

      Based on the literature, the SLC13A5 gene product is a citrate transporter. However, there
      is the possibility that other compounds are transported as well. The gene may be expressed
      in human neurons and function at the level of the plasma membrane. The hypothesis is that
      the transport of citrate across the plasma membrane from the extracellular space into the
      cytoplasm plays a role in maintaining the pool size of citrate in both the cytoplasm and
      mitochondrial matrix. Triheptanoin therapy may increase the metabolism of odd-chain fatty
      acids in neuronal mitochondria and thereby increase the levels of succinyl-CoA, leading to
      an increase in citrate concentrations. The increased level of citrate in the mitochondrial
      matrix may lead to an increased efflux of citrate from the matrix to the cytoplasm, thus
      increasing the cytoplasmic pool of citrate and allowing the malfunctioning citrate
      transporter to be bypassed. If successful, triheptanoin treatment will improve neuronal
      function and lead to an improvement in CNS function for patients.

      While investigators will follow the course of subjects with considerable interest and may
      use some of the collected data for clinical research, this study is done for humanitarian
      reasons.

    <description>Triheptanoin (UX007) is a medium chain triglyceride of three seven-carbon fatty acids (C7), on a glycerol backbone, with a molecular formula of C24H44O6. It is being evaluated as a substrate replacement therapy for the treatment of long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LC-FAOD) and for the treatment of seizures associated with Glut 1 DS. Triheptanoin is metabolized to provide substrate replacement for both fatty acid metabolism and anaplerosis (replacement of TCA cycle intermediates) required to restore the efficient generation of energy and the net production of glucose in patients. The mechanism of action of triheptanoin in restoring energy metabolism is dependent on its medium-chain length as well as its odd-carbon properties. Triheptanoin is a highly purified form intended for oral administration.</description>

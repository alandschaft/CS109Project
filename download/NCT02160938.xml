  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this multi-center collaborative study are to ascertain the frequency of
      specific copy number variants (CNVs) identified prenatally and to evaluate in detail through
      continued follow-up of the children the phenotypes associated with CNVs of known or
      uncertain clinical significance.

    <textblock>
      Specifically the aims are as follows:

        1. Determine the intellectual function of the children at age 3 years

        2. Determine phenotypic characteristics other than intellectual function of the children
           at age 3 years

        3. Determine the frequency of specific copy number variants discovered during routine
           prenatal diagnostic testing

        4. Evaluate the educational, counseling and psychosocial implications of microarray
           testing as it is introduced as a standard prenatal diagnostic procedure.

    <description>When the infants reach 24 months of age, the Study Follow-up Specialist will send all participants an age- appropriate Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) for completion.
At the age of 3, the following exams will be performed and are described below:
The Vineland-II Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS)
Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence IV (WPPSI-IV), or Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Fifth Edition (WISC-V, for siblings older than 7 years 7 months, when necessary)
Children will also be photographed (for review by the study dysmorphologist)</description>

    <description>Visitors to the www.prenatalarray.org website may register and those with an abnormal prenatal CNV result or variant of unknown significance can indicate they would like to provide limited online information as part of the ongoing registry. Study personnel will re-contact these parents annually to obtain an update on their child's development, and will enter this data into the online registry. They may also occasionally be given the option to participate in additional Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved surveys. By including these families in the registry, additional information about phenotypes will be acquired, and most importantly, the opportunity to enroll them in more extensive follow-up in the future will be retained.</description>

    <description>For 2 years of the study, limited data [indication for procedure (including detailed ultrasound anomaly data where applicable), demographic and baseline data and once available, the microarray result] on all prenatal microarray testing ordered at 10 prenatal diagnostic centers will be recorded. A screening log, kept locally at each center and not entered into the data management software, will record screening identifier (ID), consent for data collection and for those women that agree to collection, mother's name, clinical site patient ID, lab requisition number, and additional data detailed above. A screening number and non-consent status only will be recorded for patients who opt-out.</description>

        Eligibility Criteria for Enrollment into the 3 year Follow-up Cohort

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Singleton or multi-fetal pregnancy with a prenatal invasive procedure resulting in a
             diagnosis by microarray analysis of a microdeletion/duplication less than 10 Mbs,
             either pathogenic or of uncertain significance, which is reported to the patient.
             This includes:

               -  Infants diagnosed during prenatal diagnostic studies performed at the10
                  pre-specified prenatal diagnostic centers

               -  Infants diagnosed by analysis of microarrays performed at the collaborating
                  laboratories

               -  Infants referred through the Prenatal Microarray Resource Center website

               -  Children less than 3 years of age who had a prenatally detected CNV &lt;10 Mbs,
                  either pathogenic or of uncertain significance OR

          2. Children whose mothers were enrolled in the initial study (through July 2011) and who
             met inclusion criteria for follow-up in that phase, referred to as the &quot;Index
             cohort&quot;. This includes:

               -  CNVs of uncertain or known significance, some of which were not reported to the
                  patient

               -  Mosaic findings by karyotype and/or microarray alone.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Patient refusal to allow infant follow-up through the age of three

          2. Patient not fluent in the English language

          3. Patient under the age of 18

          4. In surrogate pregnancies, the &quot;rearing parents&quot; are unavailable to give consent.

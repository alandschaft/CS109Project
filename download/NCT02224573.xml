      To investigate the potential antiepileptic effects of cannabidiol (GWP42003-P) in children
      and young adults with Dravet or Lennox-Gastaut syndromes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open label extension study for patients with Dravet syndrome or
      Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who have previously participated in double-blind, placebo-controlled
      clinical studies of GWP42003-P (Core Studies). The first subject will not enroll into the
      open label extension study until the Data Safety Monitoring Committee has reviewed the
      safety data from Part A of study GWEP1332.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

        • Subject has completed all scheduled visits in the treatment phase of their Core Study.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is currently using recreational or medicinal cannabis, or synthetic
             cannabinoid based medications (including Sativex®) other than the investigational
             medicinal product (IMP) and are unwilling to abstain for the duration for the study.

          -  Any history of suicidal behavior or any suicidal ideation of type four or five on the
             C-SSRS at Visit 1.

          -  Subject has been part of a clinical trial involving an IMP during the inter-study
             period.

          -  Female subject is of child bearing potential or male subject's partner is of child
             bearing potential, unless willing to ensure that they or their partner use effective
             contraception, for example, oral contraception, double barrier, intra uterine device,
             during the study and for three months thereafter (however a male condom should not be
             used in conjunction with a female condom).

          -  Subject has significantly impaired hepatic function at the 'End of Treatment' visit
             of their Core Study or at Visit 1 if re-assessed (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] &gt;5 x
             upper limit of normal [ULN] or total bilirubin [TBL] &gt;2 x ULN) OR ALT or aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST) &gt;3 x ULN and (TBL &gt;2 x ULN or international normalized ratio
             [INR] &gt;1.5). This criterion can only be confirmed once the laboratory results are
             available; subjects that entered the study and are later found not to meet this
             criterion should be withdrawn from the study.

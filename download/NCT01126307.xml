  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is one of the most common chronic neurological diseases, affecting 300,000
      Canadians. One in 3 epilepsy patients have refractory seizures meaning that all antiseizure
      drugs fail to control their seizures. This drug resistance in epilepsy may be related to the
      over expression of multidrug resistance proteins (MDR). Varapamil inhibits MDR. We propose
      to add verapamil/placebo to patients' anti epilepsy medication for 3 months. Patients who
      receive placebo will have verapamil added for 3 months after the completion of the
      double-blind treatment period. Seizure frequency/severity will be tracked. Blood samples for
      DNA will be collected. There will be 9 clinic visits over 32 weeks. ECG and echocardiogram
      will be done at baseline and repeated if necessary

    <textblock>
      This open label study will consist of three phases: baseline, Double-blind treatment and
      open-label-treatment. There are 9 visits over 32 weeks. During the baseline period, the
      number of seizures will be recorded during 2 months while the patient is on a dose of
      antiseizure drug(s) that was previously established to provide better seizure control. Blood
      work, including blood for DNA baseline ECG and echocardiogram will be done and may be
      repeated if necessary. During the 3 months of double-blind treatment phase,
      verapamil/placebo will be added to the current medications. Visits are every 4 weeks. Vital
      signs, seizure counts and adverse events will be evaluated. All patients who received
      placebo will be offered 3 months of open-label treatment with verapamil.

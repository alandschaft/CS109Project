  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new drug called 3,4-Diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP) is currently under investigation for
      treatment of the symptoms of Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome. This is an expanded access
      trial, which means that although data from this study will be collected and reported to the
      US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)and the drug manufacturer, this is not a formal study
      of drug in Lambert-Eaton Syndrome.

      If you decide to volunteer, you will be evaluated by a neurologist to determine your
      eligibility to receive 3, 4-DAP by a review of your medical history, medication regimen (the
      medications you are taking) and a neurological examination. If you are a female of
      child-bearing potential, a serum pregnancy test will be done to ensure that you are not
      pregnant. Once it is determined that this treatment is appropriate for your care, you will
      begin taking 3, 4 DAP by mouth in slowly increasing doses. Treatment will begin with 5mg
      three times a day, as clinically needed, and if tolerated. You will be monitored for
      strength and side effects by routine clinic visits at initial intervals of once a month,
      increasing to intervals of every 2-3 months as permitted. Blood will be drawn (approximately
      1 tablespoon) at every clinic visit to assess your liver/kidney function and blood counts.
      You will have an EKG (a test to see how your heart is functioning) at your first study
      visit, after 6 months of taking 3,4 DAP and again every 2 years. Treatment will be continued
      indefinitely if a good clinical response is achieved. This study is planned to last
      indefinitely.

      You will be required to keep a diary of the dosage taken. During therapy your doctor will
      instruct you to stop taking 3,4 DAP for a period of time. You will need to report any return
      of symptoms that occur. If the symptoms return as a result of being off of 3, 4 DAP, you
      will have demonstrated that the medication is still needed. This will be done once during
      the study.

      The dosage of 3, 4DAP is individually adjusted. The usual range is 10-15 mg, 3-4 times per
      day for the full effect and will increase by 50% every two weeks to 10-15 mg, three to six
      times a day, as needed and if tolerated. Dosages above the full effect level will not
      provide an additional benefit and should not be used. 3, 4 DAP is a convulsant (causes
      seizures). A total of 100 mg/day is the maximum dosage allowed.

      Patients with clinically-confirmed LEMS will receive 3, 4 DAP by mouth in slowly increasing
      doses. Treatment will begin with 5 mg, three times a day and will increase by 50% every two
      weeks to 10-15 mg, three to six times a day, as clinically needed, and if tolerated.
      Patients will be monitored for strength and side effects via routine out-patient clinic
      visits at initial intervals of 1 month, increasing to intervals of 6 months as permitted.
      Subjects will be asked to temporarily stop study drug to determine if there is a return of
      symptoms and need for continued treatment with 3, 4 DAP. Results of treatment and adverse
      events will be reported to the FDA. Treatment will be continued indefinitely if a good
      clinical response is achieved and side effects are tolerable.

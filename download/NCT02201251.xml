  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of topiramate monotherapy compared with
      levetiracetam another standard antiepileptic drug (AED), as monotherapy for new-onset or
      recent-onset epilepsy (seizure disorder) on pediatric growth and maturation, bone
      mineralization, and kidney stone formation in children aged 2 to 15 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), open-label,
      multi-centric (conducted in more than one center) and 2-arm flexible-dose monotherapy study
      of topiramate compared with 1 another AED (levetiracetam) in pediatric participants with
      epilepsy. The total study duration will be up to of 1 year and 2 months per participant. The
      study consists of 3 parts: Screening (that is, 28 days before study commences on Day 1);
      Treatment (1 year) and post-treatment (30 days). Safety will primarily be evaluated by
      percentage of participants with kidney stones and change from baseline in bone mineral
      density at Month 12.

    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>The Z-Score indicates how many standard deviations a participant is from the population norm values. The body weight z-scores are designed to take into account the amount of weight gain that would be expected due to normal growth in children and adolescents. The body weight z-scores are by age and gender standardized values (corresponding to a normal distribution with mean 0 and a standard deviation of 1) of the actual weight measurements. Change From Baseline is calculated as value at Month 12 minus value at Baseline.</description>

It described whether a mean will be above or below the standard and how unusual the measurement is with range from -3 to +3; 0 =same mean, greater than (&gt;) 0 a greater mean, and less than (&lt;) 0 a lesser mean than the standard. Growth parameters were compared to a standard defined by Centers for Disease Control's growth charts.</description>

    <description>The HV is the change in height since the previous yearÂ´s measurement and more precisely: HV = {(h-hp)/(d-dp)} * 365.25 [centimeter (cm)/year] where h is current height in cm, hp is previous height in cm, closest to 1 year previous, d is the current date and dp is the date of measurement of previous height, closest to 1 year previous. Additionally, d and dp have to be within 0.6 years and 1.5 years. HV is the mean height velocity over the interval between d and dp but is displayed as HV at d.</description>

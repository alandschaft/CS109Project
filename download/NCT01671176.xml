  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess implant stability, implant loss, adverse skin reactions, and Quality of Life
      Benefit following implantation of the Ponto 4.5mm Wide Diameter implant. Secondary: to
      determine the feasibility of fitting the sound processor 3 weeks after surgical
      implantation, and to investigate if the type of skin reactions following implantation could
      be related to the demographic data of subjects and the type of surgical technique used

    <description>Implant Stability Quotient (ISQ 26) is a measurement scale used for Resonance Frequency Analysis (RFA) when evaluating implant stability. The measurement is performed by utilizing the Osstell® ISQ and Osstell Mentor stability meters provided by Osstell. The ISQ values range from 1-100. The more stable the implant, the higher the ISQ value.</description>

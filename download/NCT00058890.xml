  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the effect of the medication gabapentin to treat itching secondary to liver
      disease is being studied.

      There are some funds to cover travel expenses for patients who are not from New York.

      Gabapentin is approved to treat seizures in human beings. In this study, patients with liver
      disease who meet inclusion criteria are admitted to the research hospital of the New York
      Presbyterian Hospital to record scratching behavior by the use of a machine designed for
      that purpose. Blood work will be obtained. After completion of recording, patients are
      assigned by chance to receive active medication or placebo (a capsule that does not contain
      active medication). The patients will come to the outpatient office of the research hospital
      2 weeks into the study for an interview and blood work. After 4 weeks, patients are
      readmitted to the hospital to record scratching behavior. After data are collected, the code
      is broken, if patient had been on inactive drug, active drug will be supplied as per
      protocol for 4 weeks. Blood work will be obtained. If patient had been randomized to active
      medication, the study will provide one week supply of drug. After that, the referring
      physician, with whom the study was previously discussed, could prescribe the medication as
      it is available.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of gabapentin for the pruritus of
      cholestasis. Duration: 4 weeks. Some travel funds available for patients from out of the NY
      area for all the visits. Hospitalization at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment. One OPD
      visit at week 2.

      All patients have to be referred by their physician, who will receive a summary of the
      results at the end of the patient's study participation.

      If patients are randomized to active drug and respond to it with decrease in pruritus, a one
      week supply of medication is given. The referring physician could prescribe the drug for
      long term use. If the patient is randomized to placebo they can be treated with active
      medication provided by the study for 4 weeks, at end of which, the drug could be prescribed
      by referring physician if the patient responds to the drug with decrease in the pruritus.

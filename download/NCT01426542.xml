  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Newborn babies with congenital heart disease often require surgery in the first month of
      life. The risks of brain damage from congenital heart disease and from the various
      corrective surgeries are high because of poor levels of oxygen reaching the brain.
      Topiramate is an anti-convulsant medication that protects brain cells from damage due to low
      amounts of oxygen in animal studies. The investigators hypothesize that giving topiramate to
      babies with congenital heart disease before and after surgery will decrease the amount of
      brain damage caused by the heart disease and/or the surgery to correct the heart disease.

    <textblock>
      Infants with cyanotic congenital heart disease undergoing surgery in the neonatal period
      have a high rate of brain injury resulting in seizures, stroke, cerebral palsy, and
      neurodevelopmental delays. Neuroimaging abnormalities are found in 30% to 60% of cases and
      neurodevelopmental impairments occur in more than half of these children. The mechanisms of
      brain injury in these children are not fully understood. Experimental animal models have
      shown that the abundant release of glutamate in the brain during hypoxic-ischemic insult
      results in brain injury. Blocking glutamate receptors by administration of the
      anticonvulsant topiramate has been shown to prevent such injury in animal studies. This
      study is an open pilot trial of peri-operative topiramate administration to infants with
      cyanotic congenital heart disease to test the feasibility of this approach and generate
      preliminary data about markers of brain injury (serum S100B levels and urine metabolomics)
      and neurodevelopment at 18 months of age. If the approach is feasible and the preliminary
      data are encouraging a larger efficacy trial will be designed. Although topiramate has been
      used in neonates and infants to treat seizures and in a pilot study in term infants with
      hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, this is the first study of its effects on markers of brain
      injury and neurologic outcomes in infants with cyanotic congenital heart disease.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to determine the effect of reducing the number and/or dose
      of anti epileptic drugs on an individual's quality of life and seizure control in people
      with difficult to control epilepsy and who are on polytherapy.

      This is a randomised trial so children will be divided into two groups, with reduction of
      anti epileptic drugs in the first group (withdrawal group) and no change to their
      medications in the second (control group). Irrespective of the group the child is assigned
      to (withdrawal group or control group), we will ask parents to complete several
      questionnaires on 2 occasions: the first time will be immediately after the child enters the
      study (i.e. baseline assessment), and a second and last one will be 6 months after entering
      the study (i.e. follow-up assessment). These questionnaires aim to &quot;quantify&quot; aspects
      related with quality of life, AED side effects, seizure severity, and behaviour.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Legislation to allow medical marijuana has had a significant impact on the pediatric
      population of Colorado. There have been many reported different effects and properties of
      each of the over 60 known cannabinoids found in marijuana. The main exposures in pediatrics
      have involved the use of Cannabidiol (CBD) high- and Tetrahydrocannibinol (THC) low-content
      hash oil in children with epilepsy. The reported benefit of this oil is to have the
      anticonvulsant properties of CBD without the psychoactive components of THC. Human studies
      on the efficacy of CBD on epilepsy are few and limited.

      The investigators' specific aims are the following:

        -  Specific Aim 1: Describe the plasma pharmacokinetics of Cannabidiol (CBD),
           Tetrahydrocannibinol (THC), and their respective metabolites in pediatric patients with
           epilepsy.

        -  Specific Aim 2: Describe the plasma pharmacokinetics of other antiepileptic drugs
           (AEDs) taken in conjunction with CBD in order to evaluate drug interactions.

        -  Specific Aim 3: Describe parental perception of efficacy of CBD on control of epilepsy.

      The investigators will recruit children and their parents who are currently using or plan to
      use CBD for their seizure disorder. This study will NOT be providing patients with CBD.
      Consenting subjects will undergo a number of blood and urine collection that will be
      analyzed to describe the pharmacokinetics and possible drug interactions of CBD in pediatric
      epilepsy.

      Blood samples will be drawn up to 6 times. It will be centrifuged to collect the plasma. The
      plasma will be used to obtain concentration of cannabinols and anticonvulsant medications in
      order to perform pharmacokinetic calculations.

      All urine output for the first 8 hours after initial CBD dose will be collected.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety of RWJ-333369 at doses between
      200-800 mg/day in Korean and Japanese patients who have completed the preceding study
      (333369-KJ-02).

    <textblock>
      Despite the introduction of new antiepileptic drugs into overseas clinical settings after
      1990's, there still exist those patients who cannot control seizures, and thus the advent of
      newer antiepileptic drugs is being desired. This is a multicenter, open-label, extension
      study in patients who have completed the preceding study (333369-KJ-02) and scheduled to
      continue until the study drug is approved. This study consists of Period 1 (1 year) and
      Period 2 (only in Japan; planned to continue until the drug is approved Primary objective of
      this study is to evaluate the long-term safety (Adverse event, Lab test, Electrocardiogram,
      Vital signs, Pregnancy test, Physician Withdrawal Checklist) of RWJ-333369 at doses between
      200-800 mg/day in patients who have completed the preceding study. Secondary objective of
      this study is to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of RWJ-333369 at doses between 200-800
      mg/day in patients who have completed the preceding study. Period 1:RWJ-333369 will be
      started at 400 mg/day. RWJ-333369 100 mg tablets or 200 mg tablets will be orally
      administered with noncarbonated water twice daily. The dose will be adjusted between 200
      mg/day and 800 mg/day based on effectiveness and tolerance. Period 2: The dose will be
      adjusted between 200 mg/day and 800 mg/day based on effectiveness and tolerance.

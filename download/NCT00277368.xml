      Headache is often ignored as a symptom of epileptic seizures. The purpose of this survey is
      to investigate the prevalence, characteristics and classification of seizure-associated
      headaches and non-seizure-associated headaches in epileptic patients in Korea, according the
      criteria of the International Headache Society 2004. In this survey, 577 consecutive
      patients with a recent diagnosis of epilepsy are interviewed by questionnaire about
      headaches associated with epileptic seizures. It involves questions about headache in
      general, localization, severity, duration and frequency, as well as headache associated with
      seizures, and about patient's family history. This Observational study does not involve the
      administration of any drugs.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety and efficacy of an infusion of a baby's own (autologous)
      umbilical cord blood as compared with placebo in babies born with history and signs of
      hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase II study is to assess the safety and efficacy of up to two
      intravenous infusions of autologous volume and red blood cell reduced nucleated umbilical
      cord blood cells as compared with placebo in neonates with neonatal encephalopathy
      undergoing hypothermia treatment. Efficacy will be estimated by one year survival and score
      on Bayley III scores in all three domains equal to or greater than 85. This will be a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled multi-site trial of up to 160 infants who
      qualify for cooling.

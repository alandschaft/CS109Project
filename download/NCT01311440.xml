  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Oslo University Hospital, department of complex epilepsy, offer ketogenic diet to treat
      children with medically intractable epilepsy. From 2009 we added modified Atkins diet as a
      treatment option for children up to 18 years.

      We now initiate an open, prospective, randomized and controlled study with the aim to test
      the efficacy of treatment with modified Atkins diet in adults with focal and generalized
      epilepsy diagnoses, in order to evaluate whether this treatment should be offered to
      patients on a permanent basis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poorly controlled epilepsy in adults affects health and quality of life in many ways. Within
      this heterogenous population there are individuals who are motivated for a very strict diet
      in order to reduce seizures.

      Among adults with epilepsy 75 - 80 % are diagnosed with focal epilepsy, while 20 - 25 % have
      generalized onset of seizures.

      We plan to include 92 patients with focal epilepsy diagnosis. Those are randomized into diet
      and control groups.

      During the inclusion period we also treat patients with generalized epilepsy that qualify
      for participation, but these are not to be randomized, rather they will follow the diet
      group course. We assume 18 - 23 patients with generalized epilepsy will be included in the
      project.

    <description>All participants record detailed seizure records for 12 weeks prior to the control/diet period. The diet group participants are subsequently treated with modified Atkins diet for 12 weeks, while the control group continue their normal diet and record seizures for another 12 weeks. Seizure records for each participant before and during intervention are compared.</description>

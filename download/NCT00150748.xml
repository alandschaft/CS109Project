        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female children, adolescents and adults having completed the final visit of a
             previous study with levetiracetam (LEV)

          -  Subjects who were/are suffering from primary generalized (type II) epileptic seizures

          -  Subjects for whom the Investigator believes a reasonable benefit (efficacy or
             tolerability) from the long-term administration of LEV may be expected

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known clinically significant acute or chronic illness, for example: cardiac, renal or
             hepatic dysfunction, etc., which may impair reliable participation in the trial or
             necessitate the use of medication not allowed by protocol

          -  Concomitant use of any drug with possible central nervous system effects unless at a
             stable dose

          -  Concomitant use of any drug (other than hormonal treatment and the subject's normal
             anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) that may influence the metabolism of the concomitant
             AED(s), except if the dose has been stable before entry in the study for sufficient
             length of time

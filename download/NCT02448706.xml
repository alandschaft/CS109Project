  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to find out if the way a hearing aid processes a sound signal
      should be determined in part by an individual's cognitive characteristics. We anticipate
      that the outcome of this work will be a battery of assessments that will guide hearing aid
      processing for older patients with hearing loss.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Response to hearing aids is highly variable, with some individuals reporting much more
      benefit than others. Preliminary work by our laboratory and others suggests that patient
      factors—including cognition—may contribute to differences in how individuals respond to
      altered speech cues, such as those alterations introduced by hearing aid processing. The
      long-term goal of this work is to improve hearing aid outcomes by optimizing hearing aid
      processing for each individual.

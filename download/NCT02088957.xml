    <description>Subjects will receive an acute intravenous (iv) dose of Brivaracetam (BRV) 200 mg as a bolus on Day 1. If seizures recur, a second iv bolus of BRV 100 mg can be given no sooner than 15 minutes after the first bolus. If the second acute bolus is not needed within12 hours after first iv bolus, BRV will be continued as 100 mg iv dose every 12 hours (bid). The total dose for the first 24 hours of treatment should not exceed a maximum dose of 400 mg. The rate of bolus administration is 50 mg (5 mL) undiluted BRV/min. On study Day 5 (or earlier), subjects will transition from iv to oral formulation, at comparable dosing for a maximum of 6 months.
Subjects should transition to oral medication as soon as they are able to swallow tablets.</description>

    <description>Subjects will receive an acute intravenous (iv) dose of Phenytoin (PHT) 20 mg/kg at a rate of 50 mg/min on Day 1. If seizures recur, a second acute dose of PHT iv will be given no sooner than 15 minutes after the first dose. Treatment with PHT iv will be continued with at least 2 daily divided doses according to site practice. Daily PHT dose can be adapted according to investigator's clinical judgment. On study Day 5 (or earlier), subjects will transition from iv to oral formulation at comparable dosing for a maximum of 6 months.
Subjects should transition to oral medication as soon as they are able to swallow tablets.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects â‰¥16 years. Subjects under 18 years may only be included where legally
             permitted and ethically accepted

          -  Subjects in the neurological intensive care unit (NICU) (or equivalent closely
             monitored environment) having brain insult including traumatic brain injury and
             having nonconvulsive electrographic seizures (NCES) confirmed by electroencephalogram
             (EEG), lasting a minimum of 10 seconds but not &gt;30 minutes (minimum of 1 seizure in
             the last 6 hours) and treatment with an antiepileptic drug (AED) is required
             according to the physician's clinical judgment

          -  Subject is expected to be under cEEG monitoring with video surveillance in the Neuro
             ICU for at least 36 hours from the first administration of study drug

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has history of severe adverse hematologic or cutaneous reaction to any drug

          -  Subject presenting with status epilepticus or nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE)
             (ie, 1 continuous, convulsive or nonconvulsive, unremitting seizure lasting &gt;30
             minutes during Visit 1)

          -  Subject has been diagnosed with anoxic brain injury

          -  Subject has a known history of status epilepticus during the 6 months preceding Visit
             1

          -  Subject is currently treated with Levetiracetam (LEV) or Phenytoin (PHT) or has been
             treated within the last 30 days before Visit 1 with LEV or PHT

          -  Subject is on felbamate with &lt;18 months' exposure before Visit 1

          -  Subject has presence of any sign (clinical or imaging techniques) suggesting a
             rapidly progressing process such that the subject is not expected to survive &gt;48
             hours

          -  Subject has any clinical condition that would impair reliable participation in the
             study or necessitate the use of medications not allowed by the protocol

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be asked to substitute their usual vitamin and mineral supplement/s with
      FruitiVits for seven consecutive days. The study will involve 12 subjects between 4 and 8
      years of age, who routinely use comprehensive micronutrient supplementation as part of their
      dietary management.

      Primary Hypothesis:

      FruitiVits is an acceptable source of vitamin, mineral and trace elements for patients on a
      Ketogenic diet.

      Secondary Hypothesis:

      FruitiVits will be well accepted and tolerated when given orally to children on a Ketogenic
      diet.

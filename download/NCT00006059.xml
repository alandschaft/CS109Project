      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the chromosomal regions that contain genes that raise the risk of epilepsy in
      families by performing genetic linkage analysis of idiopathic/cryptogenic epilepsy.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Family histories are obtained, then the patients undergo an interview, a
      neurological examination, and EEG. Blood specimens are also collected.

      Linkage analysis is performed on specimens and analysis of shared marker alleles are used to
      identify genomic regions likely or unlikely to contain the epilepsy genes. Genotypes in
      family members are determined at microsatellite markers throughout the genome. Markers
      tested include chromosomes linked to human epilepsy syndromes (6p, 8p, 8q, 20q, 21q) and
      chromosome 3 (similar to mouse &quot;epilepsy&quot; genes). Linkage to markers on chromosome 10q are
      also tested.

      Patients do not receive the results of the testing and the results do not influence the type
      and duration of any treatment.

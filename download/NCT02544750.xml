  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial consists of 2 parts: a double-blinded phase and an open-label extension phase.
      The open-label extension phase only will be described in this record. All participants will
      receive the same dose of GWP42003-P. However, investigators may subsequently decrease or
      increase the participant's dose until the optimal dose is found.

Participants continue at 25 mg/kg/day for the remainder of the treatment period. However, investigators may subsequently decrease or increase the participant's dose (to a maximum of 50 mg/kg/day) until the optimum dose is found. Dosing is tapered (10% each day) for participants who do not immediately continue to use GWP42003-P once market authorization is granted, or for those who withdraw early.</description>

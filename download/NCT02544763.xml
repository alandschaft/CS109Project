  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial consists of 2 parts: a double-blinded phase and an open-label extension phase.
      The blinded phase only will be described in this record. Participants will receive 1 of 2
      doses of GWP42003-P or matching placebo. The primary clinical hypothesis is that there will
      be a difference between high-dose GWP42003-P and placebo in their effect on mean focal
      seizure frequency.

             randomization visit, defined as any of the following:

               -  Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 5 ×

    <textblock>
      333369EPY2006 is the open-label extension study that follows the double-blind study
      333369EPY2003. In an open label study such as 333369EPY2006, both the physician and the
      patient know the name of the assigned study medication. In a double blind study such as
      333369EPY2003, neither the physician nor the patient knows the name of the assigned study
      medication. Patients who complete the double-blind treatment phase of study 333369EPY2003
      will be eligible to enter the open-label extension study during which patients will
      transition through a blinded period to an open-label period with carisbamate (also referred
      to as RWJ-333369). RWJ-333369 is a new chemical compound with anticonvulsant activity that
      is currently under investigation as a treatment for epilepsy. Patients electing to enter the
      open-label extension phase will be supplied with both open-label carisbamate (RWJ-333369)
      and blinded study medication for the transition phase. During this transition phase
      (approximately 3 weeks in length), the patient's dose of double-blind study drug will be
      gradually reduced and stopped and treatment with open-label RWJ-333369 will be started.
      Throughout the remainder of the open label extension phase, investigators will be allowed to
      make further adjustments of the dosage and schedule of carisbamate, including independent
      adjustment of the morning and evening doses, but a dosage of 1,200 mg/day may not be
      exceeded and increases in dosage must be in increments of no more than 200 mg/day. After 12
      months of participation in the open-label extension study, patients who, in the judgment of
      the investigator, continue to benefit from treatment with RWJ-333369 may continue to receive
      the drug with follow up clinic visits every 3 months until RWJ 333369 is available by
      prescription or the program is terminated by the sponsor. RWJ-333369 (100, 300, 800, or
      1,600 milligrams per day) administered orally in 2 equally divided doses for up to 16 weeks
      of double-blind treatment followed by the option to continue RWJ-333369 treatment in an
      open-label study for at least 1 year, then until drug is available or production ceases.

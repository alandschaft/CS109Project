  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that women on anti-seizure medications are not informed about
      the pharmaceutical drug interactions between anti-seizure medications (antiepileptic drugs,
      AEDs) and certain hormonal contraceptive. The goal of this proposed study is to develop and
      assess the efficacy of an educational handout for participants on the ways AEDs and certain
      hormonal contraceptives can interact to alter effectiveness of the medications. Reproductive
      age women (18-45 years old) will be recruited from UCSD Health System Epilepsy clinics. If a
      patient agrees to participate, she will be given a knowledge exam prior to the clinic
      appointment to establish baseline understanding of hormonal contraceptive and AED
      interactions and then the participant will be randomized to receive the intervention
      (educational handout) or the standard of care (no educational handout). Those in
      participants in the intervention group will read an educational handout on hormonal
      contraceptives/AED interactions. Those in the standard care group will not receive this
      handout and the same knowledge exam will be re-administered to all of the participants after
      they have completed their appointments to check for knowledge comprehension and short-term
      knowledge retention. A same-day post-test questionnaire will evaluate participant's
      intention to discuss hormonal contraceptives/AED interactions with their gynecologist,
      neurologist or primary care physician.

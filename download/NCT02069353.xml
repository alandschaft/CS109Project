  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac arrest is the most common cause of death in the United States and as many as 590,000
      Americans suffering a cardiac arrest each year. Despite advances in care, as many as 50 to
      89% of patients who are resuscitated after a cardiac arrest die in the hospital. Brain
      injury is the most common cause of death and disability after cardiac arrest. The
      investigators use advanced brain monitoring in patients who are at high risk of death after
      cardiac arrest, with the goal of preventing ongoing brain injury. The most common problem
      the investigators have observed is low oxygen levels in the brain, which is often very
      difficult to treat.

      In this study, the investigators plan to use two additional brain monitors in the care of
      these high risk patients: a monitor for seizures and a monitor of the amount of blood flow
      in the brain. The investigators will use these to detect and treat potential causes of low
      brain oxygen levels. The main hypotheses are that electrical events in the brain such as
      seizures and &quot;spreading depolarizations&quot; will occur during times of low brain tissue oxygen
      level, and that treating these events and low blood flow will reduce the rate of low brain
      oxygen levels.

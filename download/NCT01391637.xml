    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the long term safety and preliminary effect of
      HuCNS-SC cells transplanted in subjects with Connatal Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease (PMD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Only subjects who underwent HuCNS-SC transplantation under Protocol CL-N01-PMD will be
      enrolled in this long term follow-up study.

      Subjects will return to the site six months and one year after completion of the Phase I
      study and then annually for a total study duration of four years. Phone calls will also be
      made by the Investigator to the subject's parent/legal guardian bi-annually to conduct a
      phone visit through the four-year duration of the study.

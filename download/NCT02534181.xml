      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a nutritional strategy is effective in
      critically ill patients with cancer diagnosed with refeeding syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Refeeding syndrome is a clinical entity triggered by the introduction of calories in
      chronically undernourished patients. A number of organs may be affected due to imbalance of
      fluids and electrolytes. In the intensive care setting, there are no formal guidelines to
      recommend the appropriate treatment of this condition. The aim of this study is to evaluate
      the implementation of a nutritional protocol to address cancer patients admitted to the ICU
      with refeeding syndrome.

    <description>Patients will undergo a caloric management protocol:
Days 1 and 2:
Reduction of caloric intake to 5kcal/kg/day;
Replacement of serum phosforus, potassium and magnesium;
Administration of 100mg intravenous thiamine, vitamins and microelements.
From day 3:
If serum phosphorus &lt; 2.5mg/dL, protocol will be followed according to day 2;
If serum phosphorus &gt; 2.5mg/dL, a gradual increase to target caloric intake will ensue.</description>

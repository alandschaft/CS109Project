      The objective of this study is to determine if corneal diameter and keratometry readings
      correlate to subjective comfort and lens fitting characteristics.

    <description>Assessment The Contact Lens User Evaluation (CLUE)™ questionnaire is a validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaire to assess patient experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response. Keratometry measurements of major keratometric meridians (diopter [DK]) and their location (degrees) will be collected at baseline for both eyes.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and
             receive a fully executed copy of the form.

          -  The subject must be no less than 18 and no more than 45 years of age with no
             presbyopic add.

          -  The subject must be willing and able to adhere to the instructions set out in the
             protocol.

          -  The subject must be an adapted soft contact lens wearer in both eyes.

          -  The subject must be willing to wear the study contact lenses up to 14 hours/day.

          -  The subject's vertex corrected spherical equivalent distance refraction must be in
             the range of -1.00 Diopters (D) to -6.00 D in each eye.

          -  The subject must have refractive cylinder less than or equal to 1.00 D in each eye.

          -  The subject must have best corrected visual acuity of 20/30 (6/9) or better in each
             eye.

          -  The subject must require a visual correction in both eyes (no monofit or monovision
             allowed).

          -  The subject must have normal eyes (i.e., no ocular medications or infections of any
             type).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current 1-DAY ACUVUE® TruEye® wearers

          -  Anisometropia of 1.00 D or greater

          -  Any Ocular or systemic allergies or diseases which might interfere with contact lens
             wear.

          -  Any Systemic disease, autoimmune disease, or use of medication which might interfere
             with contact lens wear.

          -  Clinically significant (grade 3 or 4) corneal edema, corneal vascularization, corneal
             staining, or any other abnormalities of the cornea which would contraindicate contact
             lens wear.

          -  Clinically significant (grade 3 or 4) tarsal abnormalities or bulbar injection which
             might interfere with contact lens wear.

          -  Any ocular infection

          -  Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable contact
             lens wear

          -  Pregnancy or lactation

          -  Diabetes

          -  Infectious diseases (e.g. hepatitis, tuberculosis) or an immuno-suppressive disease
             (e.g. HIV).

          -  Employee of investigational clinic (e.g., Investigator, Coordinator, Technician)

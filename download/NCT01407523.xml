    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

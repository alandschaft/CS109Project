  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are clusters of abnormal blood vessels in the brain
      and spine. CCMs can bleed and cause strokes, seizures, and headaches. In the Hispanic
      population of the southwest, CCMs are often caused by an inherited gene mutation
      (alteration), termed the common Hispanic mutation (CCM1-CHM). There is a wide range of
      disease severity even among family members with this disease, though the natural history has
      not been clearly described for this particular population.

      This study will examine factors that influence disease severity through the collection of
      blood samples, detailed medical histories, physical and neurological exam, and magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. The specific goals of this study are to:

        1. establish a registry/database of familial CCM cases with detailed clinical data,

        2. perform genetic testing on participant blood samples to identify other genes that may
           influence the development and hemorrhage of CCM lesions, and

        3. determine lesion growth during the study.

        The study population includes individuals who carry the cerebral cavernous
        malformation-common Hispanic mutation (CCM1-CHM). We are enrolling individuals who are
        symptomatic as well as those individuals with no symptoms. Although this disease is common
        in New Mexico, we are interested in enrolling individuals worldwide if they have CCM1-CHM.

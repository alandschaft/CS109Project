      Does polyethylene occlusive wrap applied immediately after delivery to infants born at less
      than 28 weeks gestation decrease all-cause mortality measured at discharge compared with the
      standard of care as determined by the Neonatal Resuscitation Program guidelines (i.e. drying
      under radiant heat)?

    <textblock>
      Thermoregulation is a major problem for low birth weight infants. The EPICure study showed
      that 36% of infants born between 24 and 25 weeks gestation had an admission temperature less
      than 35 degrees Celsius. Hypothermia is associated with increased risk of morbidity and
      mortality. The HeLP trial hopes to address these issues with the use of a polyethylene
      occlusive wrap applied immediately after delivery to infants born at less that 28 weeks
      gestation. Forty-five centers are currently involved in this study. Infant enrollments began
      in December 2004.

      Primary outcome: To determine if polyethylene occlusive wrap applied immediately after
      delivery to infants born between 24+0 and 27+6 weeks gestation results in decreased
      mortality compared with the conventional method of drying. Because of increased mortality
      and variable center specific resuscitation practices, infants born at less than 24 weeks
      gestation will be randomized as part of a separate Pilot Study and centers may choose if
      they wish to participate in this group or not. Secondary outcome: The key secondary outcome
      will be axillary temperature taken on introduction into a warm environment in the NICU. We
      will also record clinically important variables including: acidosis, hypotension,
      hypoglycaemia, seizures, patent ductus arteriosus, respiratory distress syndrome/chronic
      lung disease, necrotizing enterocolitis and head ultrasound results. Length of stay and
      cause of death at discharge will also be recorded. Long-term follow-up is critical to our
      understanding of the implications of any new intervention. As such, we ask parents from
      hospitals who agree to participate in the follow-up study for permission to contact them
      approximately 18 months after birth.

      Preterm infants meeting the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned within three
      gestational age strata (less than 24 weeks, 24+0 to 25+6 weeks gestation, and 26+0 to 27+6
      weeks gestation) to either the occlusive skin wrap group or the standard of care (non-wrap)
      group.

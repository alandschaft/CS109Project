    <textblock>
      The purpose of this proof-of-concept study is to evaluate ganaxolone as adjunctive therapy
      for uncontrolled seizures in female children with PCDH19 mutations. After establishing
      baseline seizure frequency, qualifying subjects will enter the study and be treated with
      open-label ganaxolone for up to six months.

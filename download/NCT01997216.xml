  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare binocular high contrast, high illumination (HC/HI)
      visual acuity at near (40 centimeters) of new multifocal contact lenses against AIR OPTIX®
      AQUA MULTIFOCAL contact lenses when worn for 9 hours.

    <textblock>
      Each participant was randomized to a specific sequence of lens wear, during which each lens
      type was worn bilaterally for 9 hours to compare performance characteristics.

    <description>The participant read a Snellen chart at 40 centimeters with both eyes together while wearing study lenses. The Snellen acuity was converted into logMAR units (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution). A 20/20 Snellen acuity equates to a logMAR acuity of 0.0 and is considered normal near eyesight. A negative logMAR value denotes better visual acuity.</description>

    <description>The participant read a Snellen chart at a 20-foot equivalent distance with both eyes together while wearing study lenses. The Snellen acuity was converted into logMAR units (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution). A 20/20 Snellen acuity equates to a logMAR acuity of 0.0 and is considered normal distance eyesight. A negative logMAR value denotes better visual acuity.</description>

    <description>OR is the amount of additional correction needed to improve visual acuity (VA). The OR at dispense was conducted with non-study product to determine lens power for the 9-hour wear. Dispensing of the study product (Pair 1 and Pair 2) was dependent upon lens power as determined by OR and resultant product availability. The OR at 9 hours was conducted with study product. All OR data is reported regardless whether study product was dispensed. Each eye contributed to the mean.</description>

             accessory solutions as determined by the Investigator.

          -  Any use of medications for which contact lens wear could be contraindicated as
             determined by the Investigator.

        <title>Mean Monocular Over-refraction (OR) at Distance</title>
        <description>OR is the amount of additional correction needed to improve visual acuity (VA). The OR at dispense was conducted with non-study product to determine lens power for the 9-hour wear. Dispensing of the study product (Pair 1 and Pair 2) was dependent upon lens power as determined by OR and resultant product availability. The OR at 9 hours was conducted with study product. All OR data is reported regardless whether study product was dispensed. Each eye contributed to the mean.</description>

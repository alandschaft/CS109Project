    <description>This treatment will be provided to patients in the experimental arm only in addition to best supportive care scheme .
During the first 3 days of treatment, the drug must be administered in Glucose 5% solution. Deliver through the largest possible vein inserting a long catheter (if possible a CVP line).
Day 1. Dose: 20 mg/kg/die i.v. deliver a loading dose of 5mg/kg in the 1st hour, followed by continuous infusion during the remaining 23 hours.
Example: 20 mg /kg of Amiodarone in 500 cc of Glucose 5%. Deliver 125 ml during the 1st hour followed by 16 ml/hour for the remaining 23 hours.
Day 2 - Day 3. Dose: 20 mg/kg/die i.v. Continuous infusion over 24 hrs. Example: Glucose 5% 500 ml containing 20 mg/kg of Amiodarone (infusion speed = 21 ml/hour).
Day 4 to Day 10. If no significant diarrhea and/or vomiting, shift to oral intake of Amiodarone as follows:
Adults: 200 mg tablets, 3 times a day, according to the body weight (30mg/Kg)
Children &lt; 29 kg: 5 mg/kg 3 times a day</description>

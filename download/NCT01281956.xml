      Background:

      - The brain chemical serotonin helps nerve cells communicate. Previous research suggests
      that serotonin activity may be lower in brain areas where seizures start, and that
      increasing activity at the serotonin receptor site on nerve cells may help prevent seizures.
      Researchers are interested in determining whether the experimental medication PRX-00023,
      which increases the activity of serotonin receptors, can reduce seizure frequency in people
      whose seizures are not well-controlled on antiseizure medication. PRX-00023 has not
      previously been studied in people with epilepsy and has not previously been given to people
      taking antiseizure medication at the same time.

      Objectives:

      - To evaluate the effectiveness of PRX-00023 in reducing the frequency of epileptic seizures
      that start from only one part of the brain.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 18 and 65 years of age who have frequent epileptic seizures even after
      trying at least two different standard anti-seizure medications (either at the same time or
      one after the other).

      Design:

        -  The study requires 9 outpatient visits to the NIH Clinical Center over a 34-week
           period. Individuals who choose to participate in additional studies may be an inpatient
           during some of these visits.

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood
           and urine samples, ECG, EEG, neuropsychological studies, imaging studies, including PET
           and MRI scans

        -  Participants will have a 6-week observation and evaluation period before starting the
           study medication. Participants who have at least four seizures during this period will
           be eligible for the treatment portion of the study.

        -  All participants will receive either PRX-00023 or a placebo pill twice daily for 12
           weeks, and will have regular clinic visits with blood samples and imaging studies.

        -  After the 12-week period, participants will have a 2- to 3-week washout period without
           any study medication.

        -  Participants will then have another study medication period, and will receive the
           opposite pill (PRX-00023 or placebo) from the one taken in the first treatment phase.
           Participants will continue to have regular clinic visits with blood samples, ECG, EEG
           and neuropsychologicalstudies.

        -  One month after the end of the second study medication phase, participants will have a
           followup evaluation with a physical examination, blood tests, ECG, EEG, mood and
           neuropsychological tests.

      Outcome measures:

      The primary outcome measure for drug efficacy will be:

      Mean difference in seizure frequency comparing the active and placebo periods.

      Secondary outcome measures for efficacy will be:

      Proportion of patients with greater than or equal to 50% lower seizure rate on PRX-00023
      than placebo

      Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Rating scales

      Performance on mood and neuropsychological testing scales

      Introduction:

      PRX-00023 is a selective 5HT1A agonist being developed as an oral therapeutic treatment for
      epilepsy.

      Objective:

      To initiate a pilot clinical trial assessing the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the
      5HT1A receptor agonist PRX-00023 in patients with localization-related epilepsy. PRX-00023
      is a 5HT1A receptor agonist that has shown promise in clinical trials of depression.
      Patients with localization-related epilepsy have reduced 5HT1A receptor binding on 18FCWAY
      positron emission tomography (PET). Increasing neurotransmitter activity at 5HT1A receptor
      sites might ameliorate seizures. Moreover, depression is a common co-morbidity in people
      with epilepsy. Altered 5HT1A receptor binding has been found in depression.

      Study Population:

      Thirty adults with localization-related epilepsy.

      Design:

      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over, phase II clinical trial.

      The trial will have a baseline phase in which each patient will undergo physical and
      neurological examination, standard blood tests, neuropsychological and mood evaluation,
      FCWAY PET (if not already performed) and MRI. During the subsequent first treatment phase,
      patients will be randomized to PRX-00023 (120mg BID) or matching placebo. After completion
      of the first treatment phase, patients will be crossed over to the alternate treatment arm.

      Outcome measures:

        1. Seizure frequency counts during the 3-month placebo and active treatment phases

        2. Neuropsychological and mood indices

        3. Safety assessment will include adverse events, vital signs, laboratory signs and
           physical examination.

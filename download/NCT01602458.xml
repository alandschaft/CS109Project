  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study's objective is to compare the global scar outcomes in those treated with silicone
      only therapy (SOT) versus silicone pressure garment therapy (SPGT) for the prevention of
      hypertrophic scarring in children with skin grafts after traumatic skin injury.

      The goals of this study are to:

        1. Examine the difference between patient scores on the POSAS scale in those randomized to
           silicone pressure garment therapy (SPGT) versus silicone only therapy (SOT) for the
           prevention of hypertrophic scarring in children with skin grafts after traumatic skin
           injury at baseline, 8, 16, and 24 weeks.

        2. Examine the difference between observer scores on the POSAS scale in those randomized
           to silicone pressure garment therapy (SPGT) versus silicone only therapy (SOT) for the
           prevention of hypertrophic scarring in children with skin grafts after traumatic skin
           injury at baseline, 8, 16, and 24 weeks.

        3. Examine the difference between Vancouver scale in those randomized to silicone pressure
           garment therapy (SPGT) versus silicone only therapy (SOT) for the prevention of
           hypertrophic scarring in children with skin grafts after traumatic skin injury at
           baseline, 8, 16, and 24 weeks.

        4. Examine the need for surgical intervention in those randomized to silicone pressure
           garment therapy (SPGT) versus silicone only therapy (SOT) for the prevention of
           hypertrophic scarring in children with skin grafts after traumatic skin injury.

    <description>This scale incorporates the patient's/caregiver's perspective on their scar. It measures scar color, pliability, thickness, relief, itching, and pain scored by patient/caregiver. The observer scale measures vascularization, pigmentation, pliability, thickness, and relief.</description>

    <description>SOT group will be instructed to wear the silicone for 23 hours/day, removing only for bathing. A new piece of Mepiform™ silicone should be replaced weekly and applied to clean, dry skin. Compression free medical tape will be used to secure the silicone in place. Patients will be provided with 6 months of topical silicone therapy. If optimal results are achieved prior to 6 months of therapy, the treatment will be discontinued. Patients will also be provided with Scar Management for Skin Grafts Homecare Instructions: Silicone.</description>

    <description>SPGT group will be instructed to use the Mepiform™ silicone only for 2 weeks during the interim before final fitting with the custom compression garment. A new piece of Mepiform™ silicone should be replaced weekly and applied to clean, dry skin. The patients will be instructed to wear the silicone for 23 hours/day, removing only for bathing.
The patient will continue to use the Mepiform™ silicone under the compression garment for the entire length of the study. The garment will be replaced after 3 months of wear, in order to ensure that optimal pressure and silicone management is applied to the area. Patients will be provided with Scar Management for Skin Grafts Homecare Instructions: Silicone and Compression Garment.</description>

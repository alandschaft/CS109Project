    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of retigabine (600 mg/day, 900 mg/day, or placebo) on motor
      neuron activity in people with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). The total study duration
      is approximately 14 weeks. ALS subjects will take study drug for approximately 10 weeks.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the major disease features of ALS is the progressive death of motor neurons. Human,
      rodent and stem cell-based model studies support the hypothesis that neuronal
      hyperexcitability may contribute to neurodegeneration in both sporadic and familial ALS. The
      investigators are doing this research study to find out whether retigabine will reduce motor
      neuron excitability in people with ALS. the investigators will also determine whether the
      drug is tolerable and safe for patients with ALS.

      The proposed study will determine how the potassium channel opener ezogabine (retigabine)
      affects neurophysiological measures of upper and lower motor neuron excitability in ALS
      patients as assessed by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and threshold tracking nerve
      conduction studies (TTNCS), respectively. The study will include the recruitment of
      approximately 60 unmatched healthy control subjects for analysis of variability of the
      neurophysiological tests prior to recruitment of ALS subjects. There will also be 12 matched
      healthy control subjects, recruited at the same time as ALS subjects.

             clips), implanted medication pump, implanted brain stimulators, pacemaker, cochlear
             implants, or history of epilepsy. Dental fillings are permitted.

          -  Anything else that, in the opinion of the SI, would place the subject at increased
             risk or preclude the subject's full compliance with or completion of the study.

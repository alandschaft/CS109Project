  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, two-arm, individually randomised, Phase II, double- blind,
      placebo-controlled trial of RAD001 (Everolimus) versus placebo in the treatment of
      neurocognitive problems in patients with tuberous sclerosis (TSC). The IMP is a licensed
      medicine in this patient group but for a different target of effect. The current trial is a
      proof of principle study for memory and executive function outcomes.

      Following an eligibility visit, patients will be scheduled for baseline visit and
      randomization. They will then be followed up for 6 months undergoing both safety and
      neurocognitive assessments whilst taking either the placebo or study drug.

      48 patients aged 16 to 60 years with tuberous sclerosis (TSC) who have IQ &gt; 60 and a
      significant deficit in one or more primary outcome measures will be randomly allocated in a
      ratio of 2:1 to either RAD001 (Everolimus) or Placebo.

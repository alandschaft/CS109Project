  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess whether a movement detecting wristwatch can accurately detect
      seizures and seizure characteristics and record them into an online epilepsy diary. The
      patients may manually record a description into the online epilepsy diary of the symptoms
      they experienced before, during or after the seizure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Typically, health care providers receive inaccurate patient self- reports. This pilot trial
      will document the feasibility of accurately recording and logging seizures into a
      cloud-based diary, under circumstances of controlled video-EEG monitoring to serve as a
      comparison &quot;gold standard.&quot; More explicitly, we are testing the efficacy of the wristwatch
      in capturing movement parameters correlated with seizure activity and whether these
      parameters can be accurately uploaded into an online epilepsy diary. In the future,
      biosensor data could be valuable to more precisely obtain seizure data for clinical decision
      making as well as use in clinical trials.

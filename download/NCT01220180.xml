    <description>Peripheral neuropathic pain: Pregabalin treatment can be started at a dose of 150 mg per day. Based on individual subject response and tolerability, the dosage may be increased to 300 mg per day after an interval of 3 to 7 days, and if needed, to a maximum dose of 600 mg per day after an additional 7-day interval.
Central neuropathic pain: Pregabalin treatment can be started at a dose of 150 mg per day. Based on individual subject response and tolerability, the dosage may be increased to 300 mg per day after an interval of 1 week, and if needed, to a maximum dose of 600 mg per day after an additional 1 week interval. In case that tolerability could not be shown in the targeted daily dose, dose reduction may be considered.</description>

    <description>The recommended dose of pregabalin for fibromyalgia is 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day) and may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Subjects who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day). Treatment with doses above 450 mg/day is not recommended.</description>

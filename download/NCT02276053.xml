             prior to enrollment in this NIS

          -  The decision by the treating physician to prescribe LCM falls within current standard
             clinical practice, and the treatment decision is clearly separated from the decision
             to consider inclusion of the patient in the NIS

          -  A Patient Data Consent form is signed and dated by the patient and/or by the
             parent(s) or legal representative

          -  Patient is a male or female ≥ 16 years of age

          -  Patient must have a diagnosis of brain tumor-related epilepsy (BTRE) secondary to
             low-grade glioma (World Health Organization Grade 1 to 2 at time of enrollment)

          -  Patient has a retrospective Baseline seizure frequency of at least 1 partial-onset
             seizure in the 8 weeks prior to Visit 1 (enrollment/ Baseline visit)

          -  Patient does not have a previous diagnosis of epilepsy before tumor onset

          -  Patient does not have brain metastases

          -  Patient has a Karnofsky performance status scale index ≥ 60 %

          -  Patient is currently taking only 1-2 Baseline anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) for
             epilepsy, other than LCM

          -  Patient has received a maximum of 4 different lifetime AEDs ever before entering the
             NIS

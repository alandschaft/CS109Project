    <textblock>
      Objective: To perform a clinical trial assessing the safety, tolerability and efficacy of
      the GABA(B) receptor antagonist SGS-742 in patients with SSADH deficiency.

      Study Population: Twenty-two children and adults with SSADH deficiency.

      Design: Double-blind, cross-over, phase II clinical trial. SGS-742 is a GABA (B) receptor
      antagonist that has shown to be safe and well-tolerated in clinical trials in adults with
      cognitive impairment. In addition, preliminary data in the SSADH knockout mouse model
      suggest efficacy in this specific syndrome. The primary outcome measure will be a change in
      the Auditory Comprehension subtest of the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery Language
      Module score; the secondary outcome measure will be a change in cortical excitation and
      inhibition measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Additional evaluations will
      include neurological and neuropsychological examinations, magnetic resonance spectroscopy
      and CSF collection to measure GABA levels. The trial will have a baseline phase in which
      each patient will undergo a neurological examination and a neuropsychological evaluation.
      During the subsequent treatment phase, patients will be randomized to SGS-742, supplied by
      IRIX Pharmaceuticals, 600 mg t.i.d. given orally, or placebo, each for 6 months. Patients
      will then have repeat TMS, neurological and neuropsychological evaluations, followed by
      cross-over to the alternate treatment arm, and re-evaluation after 6 months.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures for drug efficacy will be TMS parameters of
      cortical excitation and inhibition. The secondary outcome measure will be performance on
      neuropsychological testing. The outcome measures for safety will include clinical
      examination and neuropsychological tests.

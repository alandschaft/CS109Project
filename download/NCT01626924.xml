  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In case of insufficient oxygen supply to the brain of a newborn child (perinatal asphyxia),
      toxic compounds will be formed. These toxic compounds will damage the cells of the brain. 2
      Iminobiotin (2 IB) is an investigational medicinal product that is related to vitamin B7.
      From studies in animals it has been shown that 2-IB may prevent the formation of the toxic
      compounds. Also it has been shown to be safe in in studies in juvenile animals and in
      healthy, adult male volunteers. The doctors hope that this will prevent (part of) the
      potential brain damage that may result from lack of oxygen to the brain.

      This study is the first study in the target population: newborn with moderate to severe
      oxygen shortage during birth. In this study the investigators evaluate short term efficacy,
      safety and pharmacokinetics of 2-Iminobiotin. In the follow-up phase the investigators
      evaluate the long term efficacy and safety.

      The study hypothesis is that 2-Iminobiotin will help to decrease the brain damage after
      oxygen shortage and is indeed safe. The brain damage will be measured both in the first week
      and during the first two years of life. The study was designed as a study with two parts an
      open label pilot part (6 patients) and a double-blind randomised part (60 patients). Due to
      lack of recruitment it was decided in September2014 to stop recruitment after the open label
      pilot part of the study (6 patients).

    <description>Proton (1H) MRS of the basal ganglia lactate/N-acetyl aspartate (Lac/NAA) peak-area ratio is considered to be an accurate quantitative biomarker for prediction of neurodevelopmental outcome after Neonatal Encephalopathy (Thayyil et al, 2010). Results will be compared between arms.</description>

    <measure>The composite endpoint of survival at 48h with a normal aEEG</measure>
    <time_frame>48h after start treatment</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Electrocortical brain activity is measured by aEEG, starting as soon as possible after birth and before study medication has been initiated and continued until at least 72h after start of treatment. Every 4h the background pattern of the aEEG and the presence of seizures will be recorded in the eCRF. The aEEG will be classified as normal or abnormal at 48h after the start of treatment. Hence, for this primary endpoint, a good outcome is defined as survival in combination with a normal aEEG at 48h. A bad outcome is either death or abnormal aEEG at 48h after start treatment.</description>

    <description>Neuro-imaging by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) between 3 and 7 days following birth. The scoring system used is the pattern of injury score (Rutherford et al, 2010, appendix) in 4 areas of the brain (cortex, basal ganglia and thalamus, white matter and posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC)). Abnormal MRI is reported to be a predictor of poor outcome when at least one of following occurs (Rutherford et al, 2010):
Moderate or severe score in basal ganglia and thalamus
Abnormal PLIC
Severe white matter abnormalities Results will be compared between arms.</description>

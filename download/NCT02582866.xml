  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study is conducted to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of lacosamide (LCM) in
      patients receiving LCM in SP0994 [NCT01465997]. The study will enable collection of
      additional monotherapy safety data, and will facilitate access to treatment until commercial
      availability for monotherapy use.

    <description>Lacosamide (LCM) will be administered orally twice daily from 200 mg/day to 600 mg/day (at approximately 12 hour intervals in the morning and in the evening) in 2 divided doses. Medication must not be chewed and must be swallowed with a sufficient amount of fluid. The investigator may maintain the subject's LCM dose, decrease the dose in decrements of 100 mg/day per week to a minimum dose of LCM 200 mg/day, or increase the dose in increments of 100 mg/day per week up to a maximum dose of LCM 600 mg/day.
Subjects stopping LCM should be tapered off LCM at recommended decreasing steps of 200 mg/day/week. A slower taper (eg, 100 mg/day/week) or faster taper is permitted, if medically necessary; however, the maximum duration of tapering should not exceed 6 weeks.</description>

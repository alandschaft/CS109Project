  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Babies 4-7 months of age with positional plagiocephaly will be treated with repositional
      techniques verse helmet therapy. The helmet therapy children will be fitted a helmet at
      Westcoast Brace and Limb and monitored during treatment to ensure proper fitting of helmet.
      The repositioning children's parents will given instructions on how to perform neck
      stretching exercises and repositioning techniques and monitored during treatment. The
      anthropometric measurements will be done by licensed orthotist at monthly intervals for a
      total of six months of treatment. Before treatment, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months from
      treatment all of the children will be scanned by Star Scanner (Orthomerica) to provide
      objective measurement of the cranial vault asymmetry and index.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two armed prospective randomized controlled study deformational plagiocephaly
      patients who will be treated with orthotic helmet vs. repositional therapy. The patients in
      the study will be further subdivided into 3 groups: Isolated plagiocephaly (CVA &gt;6; 75 &lt; CI
      &lt; 90), isolated brachycephaly (CVA&lt;6; CI &gt; 90), and mixed brachy/ plagiocephaly (CVA &gt; 6; CI
      &gt; 90). Both two armed groups will include patients with mild, moderate, and severe
      plagiocephaly. Randomization will be completed by a blinded third party biostatistician.

      Asymmetric plagiocephaly is defined by cranial vault index (CVA). CVA is the difference
      between two diagonal cranial diameters (CVA= Longer diagonal-shorter diagonal). Cranial
      diameters are measured from orbitale superius suture to orbitale superius rear (see Appendix
      1). Normal CVA is &lt;6mm, mild CVA is 6-10mm, moderate CVA is 11-15mm, and severe CVA is
      &gt;15mm. Brachycephaly is defined by the cephalic index (CI). This measurement is the
      width/length of cranium x100. Length of cranium is measured from glabella to opisthocranion
      and width is measured from eurion to eurion. Normal CI is 75-90%, mild brachycephaly is
      90.1-95%, moderate brachycephaly is 95.1-100%, severe brachycephaly is &gt;100%.

      The principal investigator will recruit from patients seen at the Florida Craniofacial
      Institute in Tampa, Florida. If the parent expresses interest in participating in this
      study, and meet the criteria, they will be enrolled. During that time, the purpose and
      procedures as well as the details, risks, and expectations from the study will be explained.
      At this time, parents will also have an opportunity to ask any questions they may have
      regarding the experimental procedures, data collection, confidentiality, their rights as a
      patient, and any other questions they may have. They will be informed that their decision to
      either participate or not participate in the study will not affect their therapy. Treatment
      will begin after the parent signs a written informed consent form. During the study, data
      will be collected from general in-take forms by staff seeing the patients and from patient
      questionnaire.

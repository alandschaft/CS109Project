  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to develop and test the preliminary efficacy of a
      first-in-kind community-based intervention to provide affordable, accessible and effective
      hearing health care to low-income, minority older adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related hearing impairment is strongly associated with poorer communicative functioning
      and social isolation, but hearing impairment often goes undiagnosed and untreated,
      particularly among minority and low-income older adults. Novel interventions that translate
      research on social engagement, minority health, and hearing technology are needed to expand
      delivery of hearing health care to underserved older adults. The Baltimore Hearing Equality
      through Accessible Research and Solutions (HEARS) project will develop and pilot a
      first-in-kind community-based intervention to provide affordable, accessible, and effective
      hearing health care to minority and low-income older adults and their communication
      partners. The study will follow a mixed-methods approach that will incorporate quantitative
      and qualitative components throughout the formative and evaluative processes. Participants
      and their communication partners will be randomized to an immediate treatment group or a
      3-month delayed treatment group. We hypothesize that the intervention is associated with
      increased social engagement and communication, improved quality of life, and decreased
      loneliness and third-party disability in the immediate treatment compared to the delayed
      treatment group.

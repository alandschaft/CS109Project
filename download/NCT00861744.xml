  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two measles, mumps and rubella conjugate vaccines
      (manufactured by GSK and Merck and Company ) in terms of the immune response elicited and
      safety with a six month follow-up after first vaccination. Additionally, antibody
      persistence will be assessed one and two years after administration of MMR vaccine.

      The Protocol Posting has been updated following Protocol amendment 1 and 2, Oct 2009.

      <recruitment_details>The study was divided in 3 phases: the active phase (up to Day 42), the extended safety follow-up (ESFU) phase (up to Day 180) and the antibody persistence phase (up to Day 730).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The number of subjects enrolled was 1259. 39 subjects were enrolled in the study but did not receive a subject number and were never vaccinated.</pre_assignment_details>

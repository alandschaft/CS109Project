  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epileptic seizures may occur at times of stress and commonly increase life stress. This
      study will evaluate whether meditation improves seizure control and quality of life for
      individuals with uncontrolled epilepsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals who have uncontrolled epilepsy commonly experience disability, depression,
      anxiety and injuries from seizures. For such individuals, ideal treatments should improve
      quality of life through control of seizures and improved emotional state. Meditation with
      cultivation of emotional balance is known to improve emotional state and may also benefit
      seizure control in some individuals. In this study, individuals with uncontrolled epilepsy
      will receive detailed training in meditation to determine whether the training leads to
      improvements in seizure control and various measures of emotion and quality of life.

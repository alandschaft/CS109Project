  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many service members suffering major limb amputation(s) during active duty seek to return to
      active duty. The purpose of this study is to determine if biomechanic and/or bioenergtic
      differences exist between popular multi-function prosthetic feet that would facilitate
      return to duty for soldiers with amputations.

      Specific Aims

        -  Compare the effectiveness of popular prostheses for improving performance in physically
           demanding tasks and environments.

        -  Compare amputee performance to a group of high-functioning non-amputees to determine
           performance differences between the groups.

      Hypotheses:

      Prosthetic feet with shock absorbing and torsional features will perform better in field
      activities. Prosthetic feet with high energy return and low mass will perform better during
      treadmill running. Non-amputee controls will demonstrate superior performance in all
      outcomes in both field and laboratory environments compared to amputee subjects.

      Relevance:

      This study has the potential to quantify differences between highly mobile amputees and
      non-amputees. Additionally, it will provide objective measures of how different prostheses
      may enhance mobility of soldiers with amputations. The study will compare laboratory and
      field measures to indicate which conditions increase efficiency of prostheses during rapidly
      changing mobility demands. This has the potential to permit retention of already trained
      soldiers.

    <description>Measures of energy expenditure while walking on a treadmill were measured. Expired gas (e.g. oxygen and carbon dioxide) are breathed into a face mask worn by participants. The mask contains sensors to detect the levels of the respective gas. Oxygen uptake is correlated with effort to ambulate and therefore, the more oxygen consumed during walking, the more difficult the bout of activity. Thus, if one prosthetic foot requires the consumption of more or less oxygen than other feet, then this is an indicator of the relative difficulty of walking with that particular foot condition.</description>

The mask contains sensors to detect the levels of the respective gas. Oxygen uptake is correlated with effort to ambulate and therefore, the more oxygen consumed during walking, the more difficult the bout of activity. Thus, if one prosthetic foot requires the consumption of more or less oxygen than other feet, then this is an indicator of the relative difficulty of walking with that particular foot condition.</description>

            <title>Bioenergetics Between Feet Components 21 Days After Fitting Prostheses</title>
            <description>Measures of energy expenditure while walking on a treadmill were measured. Expired gas (e.g. oxygen and carbon dioxide) are breathed into a face mask worn by participants. The mask contains sensors to detect the levels of the respective gas. Oxygen uptake is correlated with effort to ambulate and therefore, the more oxygen consumed during walking, the more difficult the bout of activity. Thus, if one prosthetic foot requires the consumption of more or less oxygen than other feet, then this is an indicator of the relative difficulty of walking with that particular foot condition.</description>

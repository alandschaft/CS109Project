  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anaemia is a risk factor for death, cardiac-cerebrovascular events and poor quality of life
      in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Erythropoietin Stimulating Agents (ESAs) are
      the most used treatment option.

      The purpose of this study is

        1. the evaluation of biochemical markers to determine the efficacy of individual
           prediction of ESAs therapy

        2. to determine the benefits and harms of different ESA doses therapeutic strategy for the
           management of anaemia of end stage kidney disease (ESKD).

      Phase III pragmatic, randomized-controlled trial comparing different doses of ESAs in
      patients with renal anaemia.

      Study Sample:

      Total of 900 participants from Italy

      Background and Rationale:

      Anaemia is a risk factor for death, cardiac-cerebrovascular events and poor quality of life
      in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Erythropoietin Stimulating Agents (ESA) are
      the most used treatment option. In observational studies higher haemoglobin (Hb) levels
      (around 10-13 g/dL) are associated with improved survival and quality of life compared to
      lower Hb levels (around 9 g/dL). Randomized studies have found that higher Hb targets,
      achieved and maintained with ESA, cause an increased risk of death, mainly due to adverse
      cardiac-cerebrovascular outcomes. It is possible that such effect is mediated by ESA dose.
      This hypothesis has not been formally tested and is the aim of the Clinical Evaluation of
      the DOSe of Erythropoietins (CEDOSE) trial.

      CEDOSE is the first independent multicentre trial exploring the benefits and harms of
      different ESA doses therapeutic strategy for the management of anaemia of end stage kidney
      disease (ESKD).

      Hypothesis:

      ESA resistance is associated with adverse vascular outcomes and poor quality of life in
      ESKD.

      The CEDOSE trial will evaluate the biochemical markers to determine the efficacy of
      individual prediction of ESAs therapy; moreover it will evaluate the benefits and harms of
      two fixed ESA doses and explore the role of two treatment strategies, one based on a low and
      one based on a high ESA dose.

      Interventions and Comparison:

      Patients will be randomized 1:1 to 4000 IU/week iv. versus 18000 IU/week iv. of epoetin
      alfa, beta or any other epoetin in equivalent doses.

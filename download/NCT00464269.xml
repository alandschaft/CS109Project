    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects were 16 to 70 years, both inclusive. Subjects under 18 years of age were
             only included where legally permitted and ethically accepted

          -  Subjects with well-characterized focal epilepsy or epileptic syndrome according to
             the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification

          -  Subjects had a history of partial onset seizures (POS) whether or not secondarily
             generalized (Type I seizures according to the ILAE classification)

          -  Subjects had at least 2 POS whether or not secondarily generalized per month during
             the 3 months preceding Visit 1 (V1)

          -  Subjects had at least 8 POS whether or not secondarily generalized during the 8-Week
             Baseline Period

          -  Subjects were uncontrolled while treated by 1 to 2 permitted concomitant
             antiepileptic drug(s) (AEDs). Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) was allowed and was not
             counted as a concomitant AED

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or presence of seizures occurring only in clusters (too frequently or
             indistinctly separated to be reliably counted) before Visit 3

          -  History or presence of status epilepticus during the year preceding Visit 1 or during
             Baseline

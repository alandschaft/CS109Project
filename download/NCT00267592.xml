    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate overall survival for adult patients with newly
      diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme treated with talampanel during radiation therapy with
      concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide. This study will also determine the toxicity and
      toxicity rate of talampanel for this therapeutic regimen.

    <description>A single-arm study with all subjects assigned to one treatment (radiation + temozolomide + talampanel) but subjects receiving concomitant anti-seizure drugs which could increase study drug elimination had a slightly modified dose/schedule of study drug. The primary endpoint is analyzed as a single group.</description>

    <description>Radiation Therapy (RT) 5 days a week + temozolomide(TMZ) 75mg 3 times daily (TID) for 6 weeks. One month later, adjuvant TMZ 200mg TID for 5 consecutive days each month for a total of 6 months. Talampanel was administered orally TID beginning the first day of RT + TMZ and continued until there was talampanel-related toxicity or tumor progression.</description>

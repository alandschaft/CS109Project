      The CRASH-3 trial will provide reliable evidence about the effect of tranexamic acid on
      mortality and disability in patients with traumatic brain injury. The effect of tranexamic
      acid on the risk of vascular occlusive events and seizures will also be assessed.

      BACKGROUND: Worldwide, over 10 million people are killed or hospitalised because of
      traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year. About 90% of deaths from TBI occur in low and middle
      income countries. TBI mostly affects young adults and many experiencing long lasting or
      permanent disability. The social and economic burden of TBI is considerable. Tranexamic acid
      (TXA) is commonly given to surgical patients to reduce bleeding and the need for blood
      transfusion. TXA has been shown to reduce the number of patients receiving a blood
      transfusion by about a third, reduces the volume of blood transfused by about one unit, and
      halves the need for further surgery to control bleeding in elective surgical patients. More
      recently, the CRASH-2 trial showed that the administration of TXA within 8 hours of injury
      significantly reduces deaths due to bleeding (RR=0.85, 95% CI 0.76-0.96; p=0.008), and
      all-cause mortality (RR=0.91, 95% CI 0.85-0.97; p=0.0035), with no apparent increase in
      vascular occlusive events. A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of TXA in TBI
      showed a significant reduction in haemorrhage growth (OR=0.61, 95%CI 0.41 to 0.91) and
      mortality (OR=0.59, 95%CI 0.35 to 0.99) with TXA. Although the results from these trials are
      promising, the estimates are imprecise and there are no data on the effect of TXA on
      disability.

      AIM: The CRASH-3 trial will provide reliable evidence about the effect of tranexamic acid on
      mortality and disability in patients with TBI. The effect of TXA on the risk of vascular
      occlusive events and seizures will also be assessed.

      PRIMARY OUTCOME: The primary outcome is death in hospital within 28 days of injury (cause of
      death will be described).

      SECONDARY OUTCOMES:

        1. Vascular occlusive events (myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, clinical
           evidence of deep vein thrombosis)

        2. In hospital disability assessed using the Disability Rating Scale and Patient
           Orientated Outcome

        3. Seizures

        4. Neurosurgical intervention

        5. Days in intensive care Other adverse events will be described TRIAL DESIGN: A large,
           pragmatic, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial among 10,000 traumatic
           brain injury patients

      DIAGNOSIS AND INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

      Adults with traumatic brain injury who

        -  are within eight hours of injury

        -  with any intracranial bleeding on CT scan or who have a GCS of 12 or less, and

        -  have no significant extra-cranial haemorrhage The fundamental eligibility criterion is
           the responsible clinician's 'uncertainty' as to whether or not to use tranexamic acid
           in a particular patient with traumatic brain injury.

      TEST PRODUCT, REFERENCE THERAPY, DOSE AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION: A loading dose of
      tranexamic acid

      (1 gram by intravenous injection) or placebo (sodium chloride 0.9%) will be given as soon as
      possible after randomisation. A maintenance dose of tranexamic acid (1 gram by intravenous
      injection) or placebo (sodium chloride 0.9%) will be given after the loading dose is
      finished.

      SETTING: This trial will be coordinated from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical
      Medicine (University of London) and conducted worldwide in hospitals in low, middle and high
      income countries.

    <textblock>
      This project looks at the time course of lactic acid rise (if any) after seizures. Salivary
      and capillary lactic acid are tested. This type of measurement may be useful in signalling
      the occurrence or recent history of a seizure.

    <description>The investigators will assess the time course of lactic acid change after a seizure. Values will consist of lactic acid measurements in blood and saliva with baseline (pre-seizure), immediately post-seizure, then at 30 mins and 2 hours. Units of measurement will be mM/L. A positive outcome will be a curve different from a straight line, with a rise and fall of lactate levels. Baseline lactate serum level is expected to be less than 2.2 mM/L. A useful outcome of this study will be identification of lactic acid above 4.4 mM/L (more than doubling) within 5 minutes of a seizure, occurring in at least half of the subjects.</description>

    <description>Salivary levels of lactic acid is being studied because saliva is more accessible in the outpatient setting than is blood. Concentration of lactic acid in the serum and saliva from each individual subject will be correlated using Pearson's correlation test. We will consider a positive outcome to be a r greater than or equal to 0.5 and significance at p&lt;0.05.</description>

        Age range will be 18-75, men and women, all ethnic backgrounds to be eligible. Eligible
        population will be determined by who gets admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit with a
        history of generalized tonic-clonic seizures.

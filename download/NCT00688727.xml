      The purpose of this study is to determine whether adults with disoociative (psychogenic
      non-epileptic) seizures receiving cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) show a greater
      reduction in seizures and health service use and greater improvement in employment status
      and overall psychosocial functioning than patients who receive standard care.

    <textblock>
      Preliminary results from a pilot study demonstrated that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
      is associated with a significant benefit for patients with dissociative seizures. The
      current study aims to extend these findings by conducting a randomised controlled trial
      comparing CBT with standard outpatient medical care. Standard outpatient care has been
      chosen as the comparison treatment as it most closely resembles what is currently offered to
      this group of patients by the National Health Service. The primary outcome measure will be
      seizure frequency. Secondary outcome measures will be work and social adjustment and health
      service use.

      Our hypothesis is that CBT will be superior to standard outpatient care for patients with
      dissociative seizures as determined by the above measures.

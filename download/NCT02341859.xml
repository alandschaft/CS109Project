  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this non-dispensing study is to evaluate the fitting performance of MyDay™ 8.4
      base curve, especially for flatter corneas, and compared it with 1-DAY ACUVUE® TruEye® 9.0
      base curve and DAILIES TOTAL1® 8.8 base curve in a range of spherical powers.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to find out if adreno-muscarinic synergy is present also in human tissues of the
      urinary outflow tract that have a dual adrenergic-muscarinic receptor fitting. To further
      characterise morphology and function of the suburothelial myofibroblast network in the human
      bladder outlet.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Tissue will be collected from the operation theatre only after having obtained the
        patient´s consent and in strictest accordance with histopathological requirements, i.e.
        after assessment of resection margins. It might be necessary to retrieve the tissue from
        the pathologist after first pathological assessment is completed. Tissue will be placed in
        Tyrode´s solution, gassed with 95 % O2 and 5 % CO2, for functional and RT-PCR or Western
        blot experiments, or in OCT (optimal cutting temperature) compound, snap-frozen in liquid
        nitrogen, and stored in a -80°C freezer until cutting for immunohistochemical experiments.

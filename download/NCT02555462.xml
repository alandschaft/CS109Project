  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Integration of the REM-verification within the fitting workflow will enable the hearing care
      professional to easily run real ear measurements. The purpose of the two study parts is to
      prove that an integrated cooperative system, consisting of fitting software and measurement
      system, matches desired responses for certain stimuli faster, more reliably and more
      precisely at the ear drums of hearing instrument wearers than current best practice
      processes.

    <textblock>
      This two-center, between-subject, randomized, double-masked study (n=20) will provide the
      first evidence for the antidepressant efficacy of Magnetic Seizure Therapy (MST) and
      contrast the therapeutic properties and side effects of two forms of MST in patients in a
      major depressive episode (MDE).

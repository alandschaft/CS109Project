  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to open up the promising treatment of repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which has been shown to be effective against
      seizures in patients with surface neocortical foci, to a much larger population of patients
      with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and other forms of epilepsy with deep foci, who
      are not currently considered good rTMS candidates.

      The investigators hypothesize that rTMS can modulate the hyperexcitable state in patients
      with deep seizure foci by targeting its usage to accessible cortical partner regions. In
      this study the investigators aim 1) to map the functional connectivity of the epileptogenic
      mesial temporal lobe in patients with medically refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy;
      and 2) to perform a randomized controlled assessment of repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation protocols applied to specific neocortical targets in mesial temporal lobe
      epilepsy. The methods used in this study will include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of
      the brain, electroencephalography (EEG), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).

      Primary objective:

      To assess the efficacy of inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO) as adjunctive treatment in cerebral
      malaria in children aged between 2 months and 12 years.

      Main Secondary objectives:

        -  To determine the effect of iNO on long term neurological sequelae

        -  To determine the optimal duration of iNO therapy in children with severe malaria

        -  To determine the effects of iNO on circulating inflammatory biomarkers of severe
           malaria (Tumor Necrosis Factor, Interleukine IL6, Angiopoietin 1 and 2)

        -  To assess the safety of iNO as an adjunctive treatment in cerebral malaria

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite very effective antimalarial treatment, there is a residual and unacceptable high
      mortality rate of malaria, especially amongst young children. Recent progress has been made
      in understanding the role of Nitric Oxide (NO) in severe malaria, indicating that NO
      supplementation is likely to have a beneficial action in severe malaria possibly through
      down-regulation of inflammatory cytokines like TNF. Of the various ways to supplement NO,
      iNO appears to be the safest since it is very well studied in critically ill patients and
      does not cause systemic vasodilation. The safety of NO inhalation has been clearly
      demonstrated through its wide use in the treatment of persistent pulmonary hypertension in
      neonates and pulmonary hypertension in children and adults. Extensive data on its safety has
      been collected. This study is a phase 2 clinical trial that aims at demonstrating the
      efficacy of iNO when added to antimalarial treatment to treat cerebral malaria. This study
      will also provide a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in
      severe malaria.

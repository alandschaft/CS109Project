      Objective: To evaluate the predisposing factors associated with abnormal laboratory findings
      in patients who came to the emergency room due to a first seizure.

      Methods: Patients were divided into separate groups based on normal and abnormal laboratory
      results for sodium, potassium, calcium, and glucose. The difference in age, gender, whether
      this was the first attack, whether there was fever, whether there were gastrointestinal
      symptoms, the duration and pattern of the seizure, and whether there was a seizure at the
      emergency department, were evaluated.

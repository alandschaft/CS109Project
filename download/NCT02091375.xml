      GWEP1332 Part B will recruit an entirely new group of subjects to GWEP1332 Part A. Patients
      who failed the entry criteria for Part A may be eligible to take part in Part B.

      Part B is a 1:1 randomized, double blind placebo-controlled 14-week comparison of GWP42003-P
      versus placebo. The aim of Part B is to assess the antiepileptic efficacy of GWP42003-P as
      an adjunctive antiepileptic treatment compared with placebo, with respect to the percentage
      change from baseline during the maintenance period of the study in convulsive seizure
      frequency in children and young adults.

      Following establishment of initial eligibility and baseline measurements, subjects will
      enter Part B and begin a 28-day baseline observation period.

      Eligible subjects will then be randomized to receive either GWP42003-P or placebo on a 1:1
      basis, and will titrate up to the target dose that was identified in Part A (up to 20
      mg/kg/day: to be confirmed following completion of Part A by an independent Data Safety
      Monitoring Committee who will review unblinded safety and pharmacokinetic data from Part A).

      Subjects will receive investigational medicinal product for 14 weeks, consisting of a
      titration period followed by an 12-week maintenance period.

      Efficacy and safety will be monitored at various clinic visits and via telephone.

      After 14 weeks of treatment, all subjects will be offered the option of entering an open
      label extension study. Entry is to be within seven days of the final treatment visit.
      Subjects who do not immediately enter the open label extension study will commence a
      down-titration taper period lasting up to 10 days. The taper period may be interrupted if
      the subject wishes to enter the open label extension study within the seven-day timeframe.

      For subjects who opt not to enter the open label extension study, a follow-up telephone call
      will be made 28 days after the end of dosing and weekly safety telephone calls will be made
      during the 28-day follow-up period.

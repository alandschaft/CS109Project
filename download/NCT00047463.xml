  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to work out design issues prior to conducting a definitive
      phase 3 trial to determine whether treating sleep-related breathing disorders in people with
      epilepsy results in improvement in seizure control or an improvement in alertness during the
      day.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite appropriate treatment with medications, individuals with epilepsy often continue to
      have seizures, and many suffer from excessive daytime sleepiness and poor quality of life.
      Evidence from case studies suggests that treatment of coexisting obstructive sleep apnea
      (OSA)-stoppage in breathing during sleep-can reduce the frequency of seizures in people with
      epilepsy that is resistant to antiepileptic medication.

      In this study, individuals with symptoms of OSA and 2 or more seizures a month who meet
      study criteria will undergo polysomnography, a test that continuously monitors normal and
      abnormal physiological activity during sleep. Those individuals who test positive for OSA
      will be randomized to either therapeutic or placebo continuous positive airway pressure
      (CPAP)-a mask treatment for sleep apnea-for 10 weeks, during which time seizure frequency,
      daytime sleepiness, health-related quality of life, and CPAP compliance will be assessed.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age of 18 years or older.

          -  A history supportive of obstructive sleep apnea.

          -  Subject is able and willing to provide informed consent and to cooperate with
             polysomnography.

          -  Four or more quantifiable seizures per month.

          -  Subjects and their physicians agree to have their medication regimens optimized so
             that they are on the best regimen titrated to therapeutic benefit prior to the
             baseline phase of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Seizures secondary to drugs, alcohol, infection, neoplasia, demyelination, metabolic
             illness, or progressive degenerative disease.

          -  Non-epileptic spells (e.g., pseudoseizures) alone or in combination with epileptic
             seizures.

          -  Narcolepsy or another primary sleep disorder that requires intervention with
             medications and which may affect results of study (e.g., severe periodic limb
             movement disorder).

          -  Effectively treated OSA or prior exposure to continuous positive airway pressure.

          -  History of poor compliance with antiepileptic medications.

          -  Current treatment with the vagus nerve stimulator.

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  A significant history of medical or psychiatric disease which may impair
             participation in the trial.

          -  A history of alcohol or drug abuse during the one-year period prior to trial
             participation.

          -  Evidence of medical instability (e.g., congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias,
             pulmonary disease) due to obstructive sleep apnea.

          -  Subjects who are unaware of the majority of their seizures and lack a reliable
             witness.

          -  Greater than ten seizures a day.

      <recruitment_details>This pilot clinical trial was conducted between September 2002 and July 2005 at University of Michigan, Cleveland Clinic, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Vanderbilt University, with a Data Coordinating Center at the University of Michigan. 68 participants were enrolled and 35 were randomized.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Epilepsy clinic patients initially meeting trial eligibility on the basis of chart review completed the Sleep Apnea Scale of the Sleep Disorders Questionnaire, a validated instrument that assesses the likelihood of having obstructive sleep apnea, and underwent a sleep and epilepsy evaluation by the site investigator.</pre_assignment_details>

            <title>CPAP Adherence/Tolerance as Measured by Proportion of Nights</title>
            <description>This measure quantifies how well patients use their CPAP. The standard unit of measurement is proportion of nights that the CPAP is used by a participant. Data were downloaded by a card placed in the CPAP machine reflecting use over the entire 10 weeks.</description>

However, there is a large leak that prevents the subject from receiving adequate pressurized air to keep the airway open.</description>

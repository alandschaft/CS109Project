  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the new and simplified fitting method with
      Cochlear Nucleus Fitting Software (a major component of a suite of tools which form the
      Clinical Care Innovation) provides Cochlear Implants Recipients with the same hearing
      outcome as the current and established clinical fitting method with Cochlear Nucleus Custom
      SoundTM Suite. The Clinical Care Innovation method reduces fitting to simple volume, bass
      and trebles adjustments, operations which are familiar to anyone who has used an audio
      player.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Post linguistically deafened adults (≥ 18 years)

          -  Unilaterally implanted

          -  ≤ 15 years of severe to profound deafness prior to implantation

          -  Subjects who are capable and willing to participate in speech perception tests in
             local language

          -  Subjects who are able to provide feedback in form of a written questionnaire (e.g.
             Speech Spatial Hearing Qualities questionnaire)

          -  Subjects willing to give their consent to the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Additional handicaps that would prevent participation in evaluations (e.g. visual
             impairment, blindness)

          -  Unrealistic expectations on the part of the subject, regarding the possible benefits,
             risks and limitations that are inherent to the procedure/fitting method

          -  Bilateral implantation

          -  Hybrid-L (not supported by Nucleus Fitting Software)

          -  Subjects who already have hearing experience with a Cochlear Implant (e.g.
             reimplantation, contralateral Cochlear Implant)

          -  Subjects with single-sided deafness

          -  Known cochlea malformations

          -  Subjects who lost their hearing due to meningitis

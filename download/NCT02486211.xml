  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates if amantadine will increase the rate of awakening in patients
      resuscitated from cardiac arrest but comatose (not following commands) after their
      resuscitation. Half of the participants will receive amantadine and the other will receive
      placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amantadine has been used to help patients awaken following traumatic brain injury, but it
      has not been studied in patients with anoxic brain injury.

      Amantadine is a dopamine agonist and may help with stimulating the brain to awaken. The
      investigators will randomize subjects who remain comatose 72 hours following resuscitation
      from cardiac arrest to either amantadine or placebo. They will be treated with either
      amantadine or placebo for 7 days.

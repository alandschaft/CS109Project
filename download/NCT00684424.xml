      The primary efficacy parameter will be the responder rate, defined as the proportion of
      subjects who had at least a 50% reduction in 28 day seizure rate during the maintenance

    <description>Responders: number of subjects with a 50 percent (%) or greater reduction in partial seizure frequency from Baseline to Final visit. Seizure frequency in treatment period = total number of partial seizures in maintenance treatment phase * 28 divided by total number of days in the maintenance treatment phase. Missing category includes subjects with missing attack date, insufficient length of treatment period or no seizures in both baseline and treatment periods. Subjects with zero seizures in the baseline period and some seizures in the treatment period were treated as non-responders.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Change in 28-day partial seizure frequency between the baseline period and treatment period. Baseline period = the 4 weeks (28 days) prior to Baseline visit. Treatment period = last 12 weeks (84 days) of the study (maintenance treatment phase excluding 4-week titration phase). Seizure frequency in baseline period = total number of partial seizures in baseline phase * 28 divided by total number of days in the baseline phase. Seizure frequency in treatment period = total number of partial seizures in maintenance treatment phase * 28 divided by total number of days in maintenance treatment phase.</description>

    <description>Seizure Freedom (responders): subjects with no seizures (partial or other) during the last 4 weeks of the study. Non-responders: subjects with seizures (partial or other)during the last 4 weeks of the study. Subjects, who discontinued less than 4 weeks into the observation period were excluded from analysis. The 4 week period excludes the titration phase of the study. Missing category includes subjects with missing attack date or insufficient length of treatment period.</description>

    <description>CGI-S scale: physician's global impression of a subject's clinical condition, at baseline in terms of severity. Numerical scale ranging from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill subjects). Numbers of subjects in each category are presented.</description>

    <description>CGI-C scale: physician's global impression of a subject's clinical condition in terms of change from baseline.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>MOS-S: subject reported measure with 12 items that assess key constructs of sleep over the past week. Scoring based on 7 subscales: sleep disturbance, snoring, awakened short of breath or with headache, sleep adequacy, and somnolence (range:0-100); sleep quantity (range:0-24), and optimal sleep (yes:1, no:0). Six(6) and 9 item index measures of sleep disturbance were constructed to provide composite scores. Scores are transformed (actual raw score minus lowest possible score divided by possible raw score range * 100); total score range: 0 to 100; higher score = greater intensity of attribute.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>MOS: subject rated questionnaire to assess sleep quality and quantity. Optimal sleep subscale is derived from Sleep Quantity average hours of sleep each night during the past week. Number of subjects with response: YES (Optimal) if sleep quantity was 7 or 8 hours per night, or response = NO (Non-Optimal) if sleep quantity was less than (&lt;) 7 hours per night. Number of participants with shift in response categories from Baseline to Final Visit.</description>

        <description>MOS-S: subject reported measure with 12 items that assess key constructs of sleep over the past week. Scoring based on 7 subscales: sleep disturbance, snoring, awakened short of breath or with headache, sleep adequacy, and somnolence (range:0-100); sleep quantity (range:0-24), and optimal sleep (yes:1, no:0). Six(6) and 9 item index measures of sleep disturbance were constructed to provide composite scores. Scores are transformed (actual raw score minus lowest possible score divided by possible raw score range * 100); total score range: 0 to 100; higher score = greater intensity of attribute.</description>

Optimal sleep subscale is derived from Sleep Quantity average hours of sleep each night during the past week. Number of subjects with response: YES (Optimal) if sleep quantity was 7 or 8 hours per night, or response = NO (Non-Optimal) if sleep quantity was less than (&lt;) 7 hours per night. Number of participants with shift in response categories from Baseline to Final Visit.</description>

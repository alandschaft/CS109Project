  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EP0024 is a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety and tolerability
      of intravenous (iv) lacosamide (LCM). Adjunctive iv LCM therapy (200 mg/day to 400 mg/day)
      will be administered for 5 days as replacement for oral LCM tablets in Japanese adults with
      partial-onset seizures.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

    <description>On Day - 1, LCM oral tablets will be administered in accordance with each subject's LCM dosage regimen in EP0009 (NCT01832038). The oral tablets will be taken from EP0009 supply.
During the Treatment Period, subjects will receive a 30-minute infusion of intravenous (iv) LCM twice daily, once in the morning and once in the evening, for 5 days.
The daily dose of iv LCM will be the same as the subject's current daily dose of oral LCM in EP0009 (200 - 400 mg/day).</description>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to compare the overall subjective comfort profile over 8 hours
      of lens wear in two groups of habitual soft contact lens wearers (frequent replacement and
      daily disposable hydrogel lenses) when refitted into Clariti 1-Day.

      This will be a prospective, single day, randomized, double-masked, non-dispensing,
      contralateral study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A person is eligible for inclusion in the study if he/she:

               1. Is at least 17 years of age and has full legal capacity to volunteer;

               2. Has read and signed an information consent letter;

               3. Is willing and able to follow instructions and maintain the appointment
                  schedule;

               4. Is correctable to a visual acuity of 20/40 or better (in each eye) with their
                  habitual correction or the assigned study lenses;

               5. Habitually wears either 1-Day Acuvue® Moist® or any frequent replacement contact
                  lenses (as defined in 4.1.1);

               6. Habitually wear contact lenses with a power between -1.00 and -6.00D (inclusive)
                  in both eyes;

               7. Demonstrates an acceptable fit with the study lenses;

               8. Is usually able to wear contact lenses for at least 8 hours per day.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A person will be excluded from the study if he/she:

               1. Is participating in any concurrent clinical or research study;

               2. Has any known active* ocular disease and/or infection;

               3. Has a systemic condition that in the opinion of the investigator may affect a
                  study outcome variable;

               4. Is using any systemic or topical medications that in the opinion of the
                  investigator may affect a study outcome variable;

               5. Has known sensitivity to the diagnostic substances (pharmaceuticals), such as
                  fluorescein dye, or products to be used in the study;

               6. Is aphakic;

               7. Has undergone refractive error surgery.

               8. Has participated in the previous BEETHOVEN study (ORE# 20893)

                    -  For the purposes of this study, active ocular disease is defined as
                       infection or inflammation which requires therapeutic treatment. Mild (i.e.
                       not considered clinically relevant) lid abnormalities (blepharitis,
                       meibomian gland dysfunction, papillae), corneal and conjunctival staining
                       and dry eye are not considered active ocular disease. Neovascularization
                       and corneal scars are the result of previous hypoxia, infection or
                       inflammation and are therefore not active.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seizures are a potential complication of surgical repair of intracranial aneurysms. In order
      to prevent seizures, many surgeons administer prophylactic anti-epileptic medication during
      the intra-operative and post-operative period, however, such practice is not supported by
      clinical data. Retrospective review found the incidence of postoperative seizures was higher
      in those who received anti-epileptics versus those who did not. The goal is to examine the
      utility of levetiracetam (Keppra) for seizure prophylaxis in patients undergoing surgical
      repair of unruptured intracranial aneurysms.

      The drugs FEC 100 (5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide) are one of the approved
      options to treat Locally Advanced or Primary Metastatic Breast Cancer. In this study, the
      investigators will add another drug called Valproic Acid (VPA) to see whether this makes the
      treatment better. The addition of Valproic Acid to chemotherapy has been studied in about 65
      subjects with cancer and was found to be safe and tolerable. Valproic Acid is approved by
      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of seizures, mood swings, and
      migraine headaches. It is not currently approved for cancer, which is why the investigators
      are conducting this study.

      The results of a Phase I study of Valproic Acid and FEC100 in subjects with cancer that has
      spread has led the investigators to believe that this combination is better than just the
      standard treatment alone. The investigators are now testing the combination in a study with
      subjects who have either a large tumor, many lymph nodes involved or patients whose tumor
      has spread. In addition to the treatment, a main goal of the study is to find out which
      subjects will benefit from this combination. In the Phase I trial the investigators noticed
      that while this combination appears to make the chemotherapy more effective, it did not
      appear to cause more side effects induced by the chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each year, more than 200,000 patients are diagnosed with breast cancer. While recent
      advances in diagnosis and treatment have rendered a large proportion of these patients
      curable, many patients still present with either locally advanced or metastatic breast
      cancer that is not amenable to potentially curative surgery. To enhance the chance of
      complete surgical resection of the tumor, patients with very large, locally advanced or
      inflammatory breast cancer will be offered neo-adjuvant therapy.

      The use of systemic chemotherapy after the surgical therapy for patients with operable
      disease has been associated with a 25%-35% reduction in the risk of systemic relapse (Early
      Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group, 1998) Administration of chemotherapy prior to
      surgery, also referred to as neoadjuvant chemotherapy is often used in patients with
      inoperable, non-metastatic breast cancer. However more recently, neoadjuvant therapy has
      become more commonly used as it allows the direct assessment of response to systemic therapy
      and the collection of biological markers of therapy that are otherwise difficult to obtain.
      Furthermore, the relative high response rate allows the ability to surgically remove the
      tumor and achieve adequate tumor-free margins.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of breast
             cancer

          -  Patients must have &quot;locally advanced&quot; adenocarcinoma of the breast:

               -  tumors &gt; 2 cm without lymph node involvement (negative sentinel lymph node
                  mapping)

               -  tumors &gt; 2 cm with lymph node involvement (either by positive sentinel lymph
                  node mapping or FNA of palpable lymph node)

               -  tumors of any size that show extension to the chest wall or skin, including
                  edema, ulceration, or satellite skin nodules

               -  inflammatory carcinoma (stage IIIB) that is amenable to surgery

               -  tumors of any size associated with ipsilateral internal mammary nodes (stage
                  IIIB)

               -  tumors of any size associated with ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph nodes
                  (IIIC) without other evidence of systemic metastases

               -  patients may have bilateral breast cancer if both breasts are assessible for
                  response

          -  Age &gt;18 years

          -  Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of VPA in
             combination with FEC100 in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this
             study

          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1 (Karnofsky &gt;80%)

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  leukocytes &gt;3,000/mcL

               -  absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/mcL

               -  platelets &gt;100,000/mcL

               -  total bilirubin within 1.5 x normal institutional limits

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

               -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits

          -  VPA has been associated with neural tube defects in the developing human fetus, for
             this reason and because FEC100 used in this trial are also known to be teratogenic,
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and
             for the duration of study participation. Participating men must use condoms while on
             study and for at least 3 months after the trial has ended. Should a woman become
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should
             inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients may not have had any prior chemotherapy within the last 2 years

          -  Patients may not have been exposed to prior anthracyclines

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Patients with known brain metastases are excluded

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to VPA or FEC100.

          -  Patients with known congestive heart disease or LVEF fractions of &lt;50 % (past or
             current), patients with known ventricular arrhythmias

          -  Patients taking VPA as an anti-seizure agent or for any other indications

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Due to the teratogenic effects of VPA and FEC100, pregnant or lactating women are
             excluded from the study.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an expanded access use of Stiripentol in Dravet Syndrome or epileptic
      encephalopathies associated with sodium channel mutations who have failed other drugs in an
      effort to give them the best chance at seizure control and quality of life. As a treatment
      protocol and not a research study, children will only be monitored on a clinical basis for
      seizure improvement and side effects predominantly by parent and caregiver report.

    <description>The initial dose of Stiripentol will be determined by the prescribing neurologist and titrated up to an initial goal dose of 50 mg/kg/day divided into 2 to 3 doses per day. Further dose increases by 10-20 mg/kg/day increments up to a max of 100 mg/kg/day or 4000 mg total daily dose may be necessary for improved seizure control.</description>

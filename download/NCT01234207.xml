  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare objective clinical measures of visual performance
      and subjective measures of satisfaction and preference between standard progressive addition
      lens (PAL) spectacles and a new type of free-form surfaced, optically customized PAL
      spectacle.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a randomized, double-masked crossover trial, 95 experienced wearers wore customized
      free-form PAL spectacles (Test) and standard non-free-form PAL spectacles (Control) for one
      week each. At dispensing and after 1 week of wear, subjects were tested for distance and
      near visual acuity (VA) under both high and low contrast; in addition, 30 degree off-axis VA
      was measured using a novel apparatus, as was the horizontal extent of undistorted vision at
      reading distance. Subjects also completed a set of questionnaires detailing their
      satisfaction levels, adaptation times, and preferences for Test or Control spectacles for
      different visual tasks.

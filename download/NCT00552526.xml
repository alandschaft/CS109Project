    <textblock>
      This is an open randomized controlled study in children with mental retardation and
      refractory epilepsy in which treatment with ketogenic diet (KD) is compared with treatment
      with the antiepileptic drug (AED), not tried by the patient before, which we consider to be
      the most appropriate AED for the patient.

    <textblock>
      There are two trials in the study:

        -  To compare the effect of the ketogenic diet with the effect of the most appropriate AED
           after 4 months

        -  To evaluate the effect of the ketogenic diet after 4 and 13 months on the children who
           have been randomized to this treatment, the seizure frequency is compared with the
           frequency before start of treatment

    <description>An AED,not used by the patient before, which we consider to be the most appropriate will be given orally or by gastrostomy. Serum concentration, the body weight, side effects and effects on the epilepsy will be considered when deciding the dose of the AED. Traditions for amount of medicine/kg body weight or optimal serum concentration at our center will be followed. This tradition will be the same as in other major European epilepsy centers but might propose lower, but not higher amounts than recommended by the drug company. Drugs from ACT groups N03A, N05BA, N05CD, H02A or S01EC will be used including prednisolon,levetiracetam, valproate, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, felbamate, zonisamide, vigabatrin, tiagabil, lamotrigine, pregabalin, rufinamide, clobazam, clonazepam, tiagabine, gabapentin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, ethosuximide, acetazolamide, nitrazepam and other new antiepileptic drugs that might be released during the study period.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is mentally retarded

          -  The patient has tried at least 3 different AED:s including one combination with two
             or more different AED:s.

          -  The parents are willing to include their child in the study after written and verbal
             information.

          -  Patients with all types of epilepsy can be included.

          -  The patient has at least 6 seizures/month.

          -  The patient is submitted to our epilepsy center.

          -  The seizures are possible to count

          -  The patient has either generalized epilepsy, multifocal epilepsy or an epilepsy where
             it is undetermined whether it is localized or generalized such as Dravet syndrome
             classified as G40.3-G40.9 in ICD X.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The family is expected to have compliance problems with treatment and/or seizure
             registration.

          -  The hospital which have submitted the patient is not willing to accept the inpatient
             stays and the procedures that are necessary for the project.

          -  The patient`s seizures are under acceptable control.

          -  The patient has got a vagus nerve stimulator implanted within the last 18 months, has
             started a new antiepileptic drug within the last 2 months or has changed his
             antiepileptic drugs the last month.

          -  The patient has a medical condition, for example a metabolic disease, where ketogenic
             diet is contraindicated.

          -  The patient has a localized epilepsy classified as G40.0-G40.2 in ICD X.

          -  The patient`s nutritional status is not good enough or intake of fluid is to small to
             permit treatment with ketogenic diet.

          -  The patient has within the last 2 months been using medications or herbal medications
             that has a considerable effect on glucose metabolism, such as oral glucocorticoids.

          -  The patient has within the last 2 months been using medications or herbal medications
             that has a considerable effect on metabolism of AED:s.

          -  The patient uses herbal medicine which can interact with AED or Ketogenic diet.

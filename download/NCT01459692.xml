  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurologically-impaired individuals may have significant neurologic morbidity related to
      epilepsy and seizure disorders. Finding safe, noninvasive methods of decreasing seizures,
      and potentially reversing the epileptogenic process, is of paramount importance in improving
      the lives of those with epilepsy. During a 3-year randomized, pilot clinical trial,
      twenty-seven subjects were randomly assigned to receive nightly exposure to music at
      periodic intervals between the hours of 9:00 PM and 8:00 AM. A significant effect was
      observed from the auditory stimulus exposure (p&lt;0.006).

    <description>Main Outcome Measure: The effect of exposure to the auditory stimulus on seizure frequency. Changes in seizure rates from baseline to treatment years were determined and statistically compared within the treatment and control groups, as well as between the groups to assess efficacy of treatment.</description>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is the most common chronic neurological disorder in the world, affecting more than
      50 million people worldwide. Approximately 35% of patients with epilepsy are refractory to
      all available antiepileptic drugs. Drug-resistant epilepsies are often partial or focal.
      Patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy suffer from an increased risk of death,
      primarily due to seizure-related fatalities, in comparison with the general population. The
      only therapeutic option for this form of epilepsy is the surgical removal of the region of
      the brain responsible for seizures, called the epileptogenic zone (EZ). This requires the
      precise localization of the EZ based on a comprehensive pre-surgical evaluation of patients.

      Today the gold standard for localizing the EZ and validating a non-invasive technique for
      localization of the EZ remains intracerebral stereo-EEG (stereo-electroencephalography or
      SEEG) recordings of spontaneous seizures. The implementation strategy of the intracerebral
      depth electrodes is guided by clinical and neuroimaging data, including anatomical Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with FDG (fluoro-Deoxy-Glucose)
      and MagnetoEncephaloGraphy (MEG). Although the contribution of each technique in the
      pre-surgical localization of the EZ has already been shown, no wide-scale study has examined
      the cumulative contribution of these three techniques.

      The purpose of this study is (i) to evaluate rigorously the diagnostic value of multimodal
      imaging for non-invasive localization of the EZ and (ii) to better target the indications
      for intracerebral recordings (SEEG).

    <description>Pathological volumes defined by multimodal imaging (MEG, FDG-PET and MRI) will be compared to the topography of the EZ defined by SEEG recordings.
For each patient, we will sum the total number of intracerebral depth electrodes included in the EZ. Then, for each functional volume obtained from multimodal data fusion, we will count the total number of electrodes in the latter (Vol elec_tot) and the number of electrodes included in the EZ (Vol elec_ze).</description>

    <textblock>
      Patients with the MELAS syndrome experience devastating mental impairment. This study will
      evaluate the effectiveness of the drug dichloroacetate (DCA) to reduce the symptoms of
      MELAS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although many organ systems are affected by mitochondrial (mt) DNA point mutations, the
      nervous system is particularly vulnerable. Maternally inherited mtDNA point mutations may
      cause chronic progressive encephalopathies and mental retardation. Patients with MELAS
      (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) syndrome
      have the A3243G point mutation and elevated brain lactate levels. Research has shown that
      lactic acidosis is associated with progressive impairment in patients with MELAS. This study
      will evaluate the effectiveness of DCA in lowering lactate levels and slowing the
      progression of MELAS.

      Patients with the A3243G mitochondrial mutation and who have had either a stroke or a
      seizure will be enrolled in this study. Patients will be randomized to receive either DCA or
      a placebo. At a predetermined time point, patients receiving DCA will be switched to placebo
      and patients receiving placebo will be switched to DCA. Patients will have study visits
      every 3 months for 3 years. Study visits will include neurological exams, cognitive testing,
      nerve conduction tests, and MRIs. Study medicine, testing, hospitalization for research
      purposes, and travel expenses will be fully covered by the study.

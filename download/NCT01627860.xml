  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine seizure control and tolerability of Topiramate after
      either transitioning from previous antiepileptic drug (AED) or adding on to previous AED.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized (treatment is assigned by chance), open-label (everyone
      who is involved in the trial knows the study drug), parallel group trial. The study has
      three phases: a retrospective baseline assessment of patients (4 weeks), titration period (8
      weeks) and maintenance period (8 weeks). After qualifying for trial entry in the
      retrospective baseline phase, eligible patients will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive
      either topiramate add-on therapy or topiramate monotherapy. During the titration period
      (period in which the dose of the study drug is increased or decreased at the discretion of
      investigator), topiramate, given as morning doses, will be started with daily doses of 25
      mg/day for one week. After that, topiramate will be given as morning and evening doses, and
      the doses will be gradually increased every week to reach the initial target dose of 200
      mg/day at the end of titration period. During the maintenance period, the dose of topiramate
      could be increased or decreased according to the investigator's judgment. Patients should
      keep seizure diaries during the 16 weeks of topiramate treated period and are followed with
      once monthly visits to the clinic, at which safety will be evaluated.

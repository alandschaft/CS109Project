      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subject has diagnosis of partial seizures with/without secondary generalization, supported
        by:

          -  Observed ictal events consistent with partial seizures with/without secondary
             generalization; Documented by reliable observers

          -  1 of following 3:

               -  EEG at some time in past demonstrating focal abnormalities consistent with
                  partial seizures

               -  If the EEG is inconclusive or does not support partial seizures, then an MRI/CT
                  will be done

               -  If the MRI/CT fails to support a diagnosis of partial seizures, the subject may
                  still qualify based on the principal Investigator's clinical diagnosis

          -  Subject weighs at least 15 kg (33 lbs).

          -  Parent/caregiver is able to keep an accurate seizure diary.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has had status epilepticus in the past 3 months prior to Screening

          -  Has a history of any of: Cardiac (including clinically important abnormality on ECG);
             Renal; Psychiatric (including psychosurgery); Oncologic; Endocrine; Metabolic;
             Pancreatic; Hepatic disease (including clinical/serological history of hepatitis);
             Urea cycle disorder

          -  Has: Expanding CNS neoplasm; Active CNS infection; Demyelinating disease;
             Degenerative neurological disease; Progressive encephalopathy; or any Progressive CNS
             disease

          -  Has platelet count less than or equal to 100,000/mcL

          -  Has blood chemistry ALT/AST value(s) greater than or equal to 2 times upper limit of
             normal at screening

          -  Requires anticoagulant drug therapy

          -  Receiving systemic chemotherapy

          -  Requires treatment with aspirin

          -  Subject is pregnant

          -  Has been on ketogenic diet within 30 days prior to screening

          -  Considered by investigator to be non-responder to valproate for treatment of epilepsy
             (e.g., Despite adequate trial with serum concentrations of 60 mcg/mL or greater,
             subject continues to have inadequate seizure control)

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a major health problem affecting 22 million in the USA and 300 million people
      worldwide.

      Recently vitamin D was identified as a possible co-factor and found that low vitamin D was
      associated with increased steroid use. In Qatar the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among
      health care professionals was reported as high as 87% and 68.8% among school children.

      In 1 year prospective study of patient with vitamin D and moderate -severe asthma will be
      followed after slow versus fast correction for asthma control.

      This is randomized clinical trial study. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Children 2-14 years of age with
      moderate to severe asthma and proved to be Vitamin D deficient by serum level will be
      included in this study.

      EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Prematurity (Gestational age 34 weeks or less),Patients on vitamin D
      therapy,Patients on seizure medication or diuretics,Patients on chronic steroid use for
      other reasons than asthma,Patient with chronic liver or kidney disease,Patients with
      inherited bone disease,Patients with hypo or hyper parathyroidism,patients with history of
      chronic lung disease other than asthma Methodology:- On arrival, patients with asthma with
      exacerbation will be assessed by the emergency staff. Children aged 2-14 years admitted to
      the inpatient/short stay unit for the treatment of moderate-severe asthma, meeting inclusion
      and exclusion criteria will be eligible for the study.

      Guardians of eligible patients will be approached regarding the study, explaining the
      purpose and the treatment modalities. Patients will be included after obtaining a verbal
      consent.

      All patients will be treated as usual. Blood sample for 25OH cholecalciferol level will be
      sent before discharge. Patients with vitamin D deficiency will be called to receive either
      daily oral vitamin D or single injection of intramuscular vitamin D and level of vitamin D
      will be repeated at 3,6,12 months. Followed up will continue for 1 year with a structured
      phone call interview by a research assistant at the first week of each month filling the
      survey for the previous month.

      Ethical Considerations: Informed consent will be obtained from the guardian.

      Sample Size:

      a total of 105 patients will be recruited under this study. Statistical Analysis:-
      Univariate and multivariate analysis will be performed as required. Cox proportional hazards
      model will be used to compare the two treatment groups.

      Asthma is a major health problem affecting 22 million in the USA and 300 million people
      worldwide.

      Many factors play a role in asthma control (e.g. genetic, obesity, sex, allergens,
      infections, smoke, and diet). Recently vitamin D was identified as a possible co-factor and
      found that low vitamin D was associated with increased steroid use.

      In Qatar the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among health care professionals was reported
      as high as 87% and 68.8% among school children.

      In 1 year prospective study of patient with vitamin D and moderate -severe asthma will be
      followed after slow versus fast correction for asthma control.

    <textblock>
      This study is designed to provide long term safety data of TRI476 in children with
      inadequately-controlled partial seizures. This study is conducted in patients who complete
      the core study CTRI476B1301. Blinding is maintained during the transition and dose
      adjustment phase of the extension study. All patients are treated with TRI476 from the dose
      adjustment phase onwards. The purpose of study is to confirm that TRI476 as adjunctive
      therapy is safe.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who completed the double-blind treatment phase of the core study (B1301).

          -  A parent/legal guardian must be present and give written consent for all patients
             enrolled in this trial. Patients consent must be obtained using assent document
             according to patients age.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at Week 8 in
             the core study B1301.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with medical ineligibility to enter the extension, as assessed by the
             investigator at each site.

          -  Patients who participated in the core study, but did not complete it (prematurely
             discontinued)

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of a trial on an oral orthotic for
      reducing tic severity in children ages 7-25 years with Tourette syndrome (TS) or Chronic Tic
      Disorder (CTD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a 2 group, 2 week randomized controlled feasibility trial of an active vs sham
      oral orthotic to reduce tic severity in children and adolescents ages 7-25 years. Responders
      to acute phase treatment will be followed for 10 additional week (12 weeks total) to assess
      intervention durability, safety and acceptability. Non-responders to the sham orthotic will
      be provided active treatment at the end of the 2 week acute phase. We aim to assess and
      enroll 24 participants; twelve participants will receive an orthotic adjusted to the
      appropriate therapeutic height, and twelve participants will receive an identical sham
      orthotic, but not adjusted to the recommended height for the given participant.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 7-25 inclusive.

          -  Presence of motor and/or vocal tics for at least 12 months.

          -  Tics are of at least moderate clinical severity as evidenced by a Yale Global Tic
             Severity score of 14 or higher for motor or vocal tics only and 22 or higher for
             Tourette syndrome and present during the baseline assessment.

          -  IQ estimate of 70 or higher

          -  Comorbid disorder (e.g., ADHD, OCD, ODD) will be allowed provided that the tic
             symptoms are of primary concern to parents and comorbid symptoms are not of
             sufficient severity to require immediate treatment other than that provided by the
             current study.

          -  Pre-existing stable medication (see protocol for details), tic or otherwise, will
             also be allowed provided the family agrees to refrain from med changes over the
             course of the acute phase of the study

          -  Sufficient command of the English language to participate in informed consent and
             assessment procedures.

          -  Agree for videotaping of study procedures

          -  Clearance by treating dentist: Certification of good dental health provided by the
             subjects current dentist prior to enrollment in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Major psychiatric disorder at screening that would preclude full participation in
             study procedures including psychosis, mania, depression, untreated combined type
             ADHD, autism and pervasive developmental disorders.

          -  Medication changes are planned during the acute and follow-up phase of treatment.

          -  Other dental health problems that might interfere with the assessment, installation,
             or wearing of orthotic device.

          -  Does not consent to being videotaped

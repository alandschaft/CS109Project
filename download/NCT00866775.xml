      This is an 18-week, double-blind, randomized, historical control, multicenter study with
      gradual conversion to monotherapy in subjects with partial onset seizures who are not well
      controlled by current AEDs. The 18 week double-blind treatment period consists of a 2-week
      period for titration of study drug, 6-week period for taper or conversion off AEDs, and a
      10-week monotherapy period. Subjects not entering an optional open-label extension study
      will enter a 1-week period to taper off study drug followed by an end of study visit (week
      19). This study was previously posted by Sepracor Inc. In October 2009, Sepracor Inc. was
      acquired by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma., and in October 2010, Sepracor Inc's name was changed
      to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of partial epilepsy as defined in the Classification of Seizures of the

             motor component, or complex, with or without secondary generalization) a. Medical
             history of seizures; b. Absence of confounding factors (pseudoseizures, syncope); c.
             Documented EEG recording (done within 5 years prior to screening) consistent with
             focal onset epilepsy.

          -  Documented CT or MRI scan conducted within 10 years prior to screening, showing the
             absence of a progressive structural abnormality (eg, tumor). Mesial temporal
             sclerosis is acceptable.

          -  ≥4 partial onset seizures during the 8 weeks prior screening with no 28-day seizure

             subject.

          -  Subjects must give written informed consent prior to participation in the study. For
             subjects &lt;18 years of age, the informed consent must be signed by the subject's
             parent or legal guardian, and, when appropriate and/or required by state or local
             law, minor subjects must give written informed assent prior to participation in the
             study. Subjects of Asian ancestry are required to give written informed consent for
             genotyping. All subjects must sign a HIPAA Form. All females of child bearing
             potential must also sign the &quot;Women of Childbearing Potential&quot; Addendum.

             Non-childbearing potential (ie, physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant,
             including any female who is pre-menarchal or post-menopausal); b. Child-bearing
             potential (all females ≤65 years of age), has a negative pregnancy test at screening
             and agrees to satisfy contraception requirements.

          -  Subjects with progressive structural central nervous system lesion or progressive
             encephalopathy.

          -  Psychiatric exclusion criteria: subjects with history of suicide attempt in last 2
             years; major depressive episode within last 6 months; abuse of alcohol or substance
             abuse in last 2 years; significant psychiatric disorder or recurrent episodes of
             severe depression within 2 years prior to screening.

          -  Medical exclusion criteria: known renal insufficiency or subject with estimated
             creatinine clearance [CrCL] &lt;60 mL/min based on serum creatinine using the
             Cockcroft-Gault formula.

          -  Clinical and laboratory exclusion criteria: Subjects of Asian ancestry who tests
             positive for the presence of the HLA-B*1502 allele.

          -  Subjects who have been on benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, or primidone on a regular
             basis within 3 months prior to screening.

          -  Subjects taking antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, anxiolytics, sedative
             hypnotics including non-benzodiazepines, central opioid agonists/antagonists,
             monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) within at least 5 half lives (or for at least 2
             weeks whichever is longer) prior to randomization.

          -  Subjects presently on felbamate or vigabatrin

          -  Female subjects who are currently breastfeeding or intending to breastfeed during
             study period.

      The LittlEARS Auditory Questionnaire is designed to assess the development of the auditory
      behavior in children during the first two (hearing) years. The questionnaire has been
      validated on children with normal hearing whose native language is German. A comparison was
      made between North American English speaking children with normal hearing and found that it
      was consistent with the German data. This study is to validate the questionnaire in children
      with cochlear implants.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pre-licensure cohort study will estimate the incidence of protocol-defined potential
      adverse events of special interest (AESI), meningitis and other serious adverse events
      (SAEs) in sub-Saharan African children under 3 years of age. The outcomes of this study will
      provide the baseline data for the post-licensure EPI-MALARIA-003 VS AME (115056) study that
      will evaluate the safety and impact of the RTS,S/AS01E vaccine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The outcomes of interest (AESI, meningitis and SAEs) as well as data on all-cause morbidity
      and mortality will be captured through active and passive surveillance in children &lt; 3 years
      of age. Children &lt;18 months will be visited at their home at regular intervals during a
      period of 8 months (active surveillance). For all enrolled children &lt;3 years of age, all
      hospitalization events will be captured during the total study period (passive
      surveillance). The protocol summary has been updated with Protocol amendment 2 (dated
      03-Jun-2014) information:

      Rationale for amendment:

        -  The EPI-MALARIA-002 VS AME (115055) protocol will serve to collect baseline information
           necessary to prepare the Post Authorisation Safety Study (PASS) EPI-MALARIA-003 VS AME
           (115056) that will start with the implementation of the RTS,S/AS01E vaccine in
           Sub-Saharan Africa.

        -  Although EPI-MALARIA-002 VS AME (115055) is not a targeted safety study, Protocol
           Amendment 2 revised the format of the protocol to a &quot;PASS protocol&quot;, proposed by the
           new EMA pharmacovigilance guidance [European Medicines Agency, 2012], and is therefore
           in alignment with EPI-MALARIA-003 VS AME (115056) .

        -  For clarity, consistency and comparability in the objectives, endpoints and
           methodologies, Protocol Amendment 2 text has been aligned in EPI-MALARIA-002 VS AME
           (115055) with the EPI-MALARIA-003 VS AME (115056) protocol.

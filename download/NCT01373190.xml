  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim is to determine if there are patterns of temperature differences in the
      abdominal and back regions of individuals with partial/focal onset epilepsy as compared to a
      non-epileptic control group. The hypothesis is that individuals with partial/focal onset
      epilepsy will have colder recorded temperatures in the abdominal area than individuals in a
      matched control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The concept of &quot;Abdominal Epilepsy&quot; has been described in the neurology literature. The
      present study seeks to amplify understanding of this clinical entity by measuring abdominal
      area and low back skin temperature changes which may be affected through the function of the
      abdominal ganglia, specifically the Celiac, Superior Mesenteric and Inferior Mesenteric
      Ganglia.

      This not an intervention study. It is study comparing abdominal area and low back skin
      temperature in individuals with the Partial/Focal Onset Epilepsy with a match control group
      of individuals with no epilepsy history. The implications of the outcome of the finding any
      significant temperature changes between the experimental and control groups is great enough
      to warrant the highest level of scientific scrutiny that this registration permits.

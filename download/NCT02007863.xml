    <textblock>
      Unrelated Cord Blood (UCB) transplant in children is a viable stem cell transplant modality
      for patients with leukemia and myelodysplasia. UCB is now considered &quot;Standard Of Care&quot; in
      cases where a suitable living bone marrow donor is not available. The survival of UCB is
      similar to Matched Unrelated Marrow Transplant. This study is considered &quot;Research&quot; since
      UCB is not a licensed product and requires IND. THERE ARE NO SPECIFIC RESEARCH QUESTIONS IN
      THIS PROTOCOL. This protocol merely provides UCB as a stem cell treatment modality to
      pediatric patients who may require it after a conditioning regimen that excludes total body
      irradiation (TBI).

      The preparative regimen will consist of:

        -  Fludarabine: 25 mg/m2/day IV x 5 doses on Days -13, to -9

        -  Busulfan 1mg/kg IV every 6 hrs x 16 doses on Days -8 to -5

        -  Melphalan 45 mg/m2/day IV x 3 doses on days -4 to -2

        -  ATGAM 30mg/kg/day x 3 doses on Days -3 to -1

        -  Day 0 will be the day of the UCB Transplant

        -  The GVHD prophylaxis will be Cyclosporin A to maintain level 200-400 beginning on Day
           -3, through 200-400. Solumedrol at 1mg/kg/day on Day 1 until D+4, then solumedrol
           2mg/kg/day until Day +19 or till ANC reaches 500/mm2, then taper by 0.2 mg/kg/week.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be up to 21 years of age

          -  Patients cannot receive total body irradiation (TBI) because of:

               -  Young age - &lt; 2 years at diagnosis of leukemia resulting in an age &lt; 4 years at
                  transplantation (due to risk of severe growth retardation and brain damage).

               -  Inability to tolerate TBI because of prior radiation or organ toxicity.

               -  Refractory/multiply relapsed leukemia, for which a traditional
                  TBI/cyclophosphamide regimen would unlikely lead to a successful outcome.

             minimally at 4 of 6 HLA-A and B (at intermediate resolution by molecular typing) and
             DRB1 (at high resolution by molecular typing) loci with the patient. The unit must

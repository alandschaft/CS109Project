  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this proposed research is to identify individuals in southeastern Arizona
      aged 65 years and older who have new onset seizures (or newly diagnosed epilepsy) and
      monitor them for at least two years. In doing so the investigators will be able to describe
      the public health burden of this condition and to identify factors that predict clinical
      outcomes and health care needs in this population, using quantitative, administrative, and
      qualitative data. The aims of this proposed research are 1) to determine the two-year
      incidence of newly diagnosed epilepsy in the target population, 2) describe health care
      resource utilization of the target population using Medicare data, 3) validate the use of
      Medicare beneficiary data to estimate incidence of epilepsy, and 4) describe the burden of
      this condition in different ethnic groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seniors who have had new onset seizures or newly diagnosed epilepsy will be recruited from
      emergency departments (EDs), neurology clinics, primary care clinics (including geriatric
      clinics), and other service providers from networks maintained by the Area Agencies on Aging
      that serve seniors in southeastern Arizona. Data will be collected in the form of bi-annual
      surveys,administrative data (from Medicare), in-depth interviews, and focus groups. Medicare
      data will be used to describe and evaluate the likelihood of being hospitalized or admitted
      to a long-term facility within two years of being diagnosed, medication adherence and
      persistence, and comparing the cost of care between the newly-diagnosed seniors with
      epilepsy and comparable seniors who do not have epilepsy. The feasibility and validity of
      using the Medicare claims data to estimate newly diagnosed epilepsy will also be assessed.
      Finally, the impact of epilepsy on health related quality of life, mental health, perceived
      stigma, and family and caregivers will also be evaluated through surveys and qualitative
      data collection methods, and ethnic differences will also be described.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Japanese encephalitis is the single largest cause of viral encephalitis in the world today.
      It occurs in yearly post monsoon outbreaks in Uttar Pradesh and other parts of India and
      south east Asia. There is presently no antiviral drug of proven benefit for this illness and
      treatment is mostly supportive. The drug Ribavirin is already in the market in use for other
      indications. It has been found useful in West Nile encephalitis and various hemorrhagic
      fevers caused by related arboviruses. This is a double blind placebo of Ribavirin in
      Japanese encephalitis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such trial in the
      world. The study hypothesis is that children treated with ribavirin will be no different
      from those getting placebo in terms of mortality, length of hospital stay, days to return to
      consciousness and oral feeds, days to become afebrile and convulsion free and in 3 month
      sequelae rate.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric patients are admitted to the emergency room for diverse causes, beside trauma,
      patients can present with convulsions, suspicion of brain tumor or increased intracranial
      pressure. In most of the cases a brain CT is performed even before physical examination by a
      skilled neurologist. The amount of radiation that the children are exposed is equivalent to
      100 plain chest X rays. The purpose of this tudy is to examinate in a retrospective study
      what were the indications for CT study and what was the incidence of relevant abnormal
      findings that required emergency intervention or referral.

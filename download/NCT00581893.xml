  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Automobile driving is a crucial aspect of everyday life, yet vehicular crashes represent a
      serious public health problem. Patients with epilepsy are at elevated risk for automobile
      crashes, causing great personal suffering and financial costs to society. Most collisions
      involving epileptic drivers are not seizure related but may instead result from cognitive
      effects upon driving performance of epilepsy and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Several million
      American drivers take AEDs for treatment of medical conditions besides epilepsy and may also
      be at risk for cognitive impairments that can reduce driving performance. Empirical evidence
      of the effects of AEDs on driving performance would enable development of driving guidelines
      that could lower the risk of injurious motor vehicle collisions; however, this evidence is
      currently lacking. The broad goal of our project is to determine the specific effects of the
      most commonly utilized AED, phenytoin, by assessing driving performance and cognitive
      abilities in neurologically normal volunteers taking phenytoin in a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Our proposed experiments will assess: (1)
      cognitive functions using standardized neuropsychological tests (of attention, perception,
      memory, and executive functions), (2) driving performance during phenytoin and placebo
      administration, and (3) the effects of phenytoin-related cognitive performance upon driving
      performance. To measure driving performance, we will use a state-of-the-art fixed-base
      interactive driving simulator that allows us to observe driver errors in an environment that
      is challenging yet safe for the driver and tester, under conditions of optimal stimulus and
      response control. The results of this study of 30 drivers treated with phenytoin and placebo
      will increase the understanding of the role of AED-related cognitive impairment on driving
      safety errors. A better understanding of the impact of AEDs upon driving performance is
      necessary to rationally develop interventions that could help prevent crashes by drivers
      treated with AEDs.

      Patients with epilepsy are at elevated risk for automobile crashes, causing great personal
      suffering and financial costs to society. Most collisions involving epileptic drivers are
      not seizure related but may instead result from cognitive effects upon driving performance
      of epilepsy and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Several million American drivers take AEDs for
      treatment of medical conditions besides epilepsy and may also be at risk for cognitive
      impairments that can reduce driving performance. Empirical evidence of the effects of AEDs
      on driving performance would enable development of driving guidelines that could lower the
      risk of injurious motor vehicle collisions; however, this evidence is currently lacking.

      The broad goal of the current project is to determine the specific effects of AEDs on
      cognitive function and driving performance. To address this goal we will assess driving
      performance and cognitive abilities in neurologically normal volunteers taking phenytoin
      (Dilantin), the most commonly prescribed AED. Effects of phenytoin on driving performance
      and cognition will be addressed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover
      study. Driver cognition will be assessed using a battery of neuropsychological tests.
      Driving performance will be objectively assessed in all participants on standardized tasks
      enacted in a state-of-the-art driving simulator. Our 3 Specific Aims are:

      Aim 1: To assess the effects of phenytoin on cognitive abilities that are crucial to the
      driving task, including perception, attention, memory, and executive function.

      Hypothesis 1: A driver's cognitive abilities will decline during steady-state phenytoin
      administration compared to placebo. Drivers with higher blood levels of phenytoin will show
      greater decline.

      Aim 2: To assess effects of phenytoin on driving performance and safety errors in a
      state-of-the-art driving simulator.

      Hypothesis 2: Driving performance will decline and driver safety errors will increase during
      phenytoin administration compared to placebo. Drivers with higher blood levels of phenytoin
      will show greater impairments of driving.

      Aim 3: To assess the effects of phenytoin-related cognitive impairments upon driving
      performance in a state-of-the-art driving simulator.

      Hypothesis 3. Impairments of cognitive function affecting perception, attention, memory,
      executive function, and arousal will increase the likelihood of driver errors that may lead
      to a crash.

      Our hypotheses would be supported if the drivers taking phenytoin, as opposed to placebo,
      demonstrate worse cognitive performance on neuropsychological tests, and more safety errors
      and crashes in the simulator. The hypotheses would also be supported if drivers with higher
      phenytoin levels show greater impairments of cognition and driving. Once the effects of
      phenytoin on driving performance are demonstrated in this project, we will have evidence to
      support more comprehensive research addressing specific dosing and serum levels and acute
      versus chronic administration.

      There is currently no evidence concerning the effects of phenytoin on driving performance.
      Accurate driving performance data on patients receiving phenytoin would allow determination
      of fair and accurate criteria for making recommendations to drive or not to drive affecting
      millions of patients taking AEDS for epilepsy and other conditions. These data could also
      help reduce the risk of car crashes due to medication side effects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Anticipating a 10-15% drop-out rate, we will induct 30 neurologically normal subjects
             (age 18 (21) -60) to obtain 25 evaluable subjects who are legally licensed to drive
             in their state of residence and have been actively driving under appropriate legal
             guidelines for at least 5 years (to minimize performance variations of novice
             drivers).

          -  Because this study is intended to determine the potential effects of phenytoin on
             driving performance, a relatively healthy cohort of patients must be chosen. Chronic
             medical or psychiatric conditions could cause significant alterations in driving
             performance independent of those caused by phenytoin, which would complicate
             interpretation of performance impairments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are younger than 18 or older than 60

          -  Have history of prior seizures, family history of epilepsy, or prior history of head
             injury

          -  Have a known history of prior drug or alcohol abuse or unwillingness to abstain from
             drug or alcohol use during the study period

          -  Have a past or current active neurological or psychiatric disorder that could impair
             cognitive or driving performance (i.e. baseline IQ &lt; 90, dementia, mental
             retardation, stroke, severe head injury, schizophrenia, active clinical depression,
             progressive brain tumor).

          -  Subjects who have a chronic medical condition (i.e. diabetes mellitus, renal
             insufficiency, congestive heart failure, hepatic dysfunction, hematologic condition,
             HIV)

          -  Taking medications known to affect the central nervous system (i.e. baseline
             pre-study treatment with antiepileptic drug, anxiolytics, sedatives, hypnotics,
             antidepressants, antipsychotics, narcotics and tranquilizers)

          -  Regularly use over-the-counter cough suppressants, antihistamines, or sleep aids; or
             who ingest over 7 cups of daily coffee or currently smoke cigarettes.

          -  Subjects will be excluded if they cannot complete SIREN testing or neuropsychological
             instruments because of visual or hearing impairment (history or screening discovery
             of corrected visual acuity of less than 20/50) or other physical disability, or if
             they have a history of severe motion sickness as an adult—a marker for patients who
             develop simulator sickness and therefore cannot participate in SIREN testing.

3 Thyroglobulin Tg levels greater than or equal to 100 ng/ml in the absence of Tg antibodies Patients who are Tg-antibody Tg-Ab positive may be included despite a lower Tg level if they have detectable disease on cross sectional imaging The presence of Tg-Ab may lead to falsely low Tg levels and therefore render the Tg a less sensitive marker of disease However Tg-Ab has been shown to also act as a tumor marker and will be used as an endpoint for the study in patients who are Tg-Ab positive

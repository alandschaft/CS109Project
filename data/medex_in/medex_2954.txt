The sample at study endpoint will contain 50 children diagnosed with idiopathic autism and regression AUT-R 50 children diagnosed with idiopathic autism and no history of regression AUT-NR 75 typically developing children TYP matched on ethnicity sex chronological age and daycare enrollment Matching for daycare setting home versus setting with other children will be attempted due to the potentially greater immunologic challenge experienced by children in daycare settings In addition as many as 40 children with autism with or without a history of regression will be included in the evaluations and 50 children with developmental delays without autism will be recruited as contrast subjects The age range of all groups will be between 12 and 60 months at first visit We will over-recruit for children in the 12-36 month age range in order to maximize participants of the age when regression associated with autism diagnosis is most likely

Patients must have unequivocal evidence for tumor progression by magnetic resonance imaging MRI or computerized tomography CT scan This scan should be performed within 14 days prior to registration and on a steroid dosage that has been stable for at least 5 days If the steroid dose is increased between the date of imaging and registration a new baseline MR/CT is required The same type of scan i.e. MRI or CT must be used throughout the period of protocol treatment for tumor measurement

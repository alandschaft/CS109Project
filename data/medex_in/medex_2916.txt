Any patient who has received an antihypertensive medication within 6 hours prior to enrollment will not be eligible but those who have received antihypertensive medications other than beta-blockers or magnesium sulfate may still be enrolled as long as they have not been given a dose within the 6 hours prior to enrollment If a patient has received MgSO4 or a short acting beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker more than 12 hours prior to enrollment or if they have received a long acting beta-blocker more than 24 hours before enrollment she may still be considered eligible This stipulation will allow increased recruitment of patients especially those with chronic hypertension and those transferred from outlying institutions We expect these patients to be a minority of the enrollment

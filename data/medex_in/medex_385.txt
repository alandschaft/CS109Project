The proposed age range 6 mo to 3 yrs was chosen because these children are expected to have a mild to moderate neurological deficiency but are well enough to be cared for at home by the family Therefore these patients should not require extensive medical or nursing care during their stay at the Clinical Center Moreover the patients are locally cared for by neurologists and pediatricians on a regular basis and such care will continue when the patients return home

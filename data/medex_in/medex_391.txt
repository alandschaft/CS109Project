The rigid age exclusion criteria will be used because the majority of INCL patients have more frequent seizures complete retinal blindness and significant cerebral atrophy beyond 3 years of age Dr. Santavuori one of our consultants who is now deceased who had the most extensive experience with these patients believed that the neurological degeneration after age 2 might not be reversible While Dr. Santavuori s speculation is well taken we feel that since to date there has not been any effective treatment to slow the progression of neuronal death in INCL and since our preliminary results show that Cystagon slows the progression of neurodegeneration we feel that a combination of Cystagon plus N-Ac with its anti-apoptotic and neuro-protective effects may show some added benefits over Cystagon therapy alone

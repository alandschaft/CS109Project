Although there is overlap in the age period for regression specified in this protocol regression between 15-30 months and that described for childhood disintegrative disorder CDD the DSM-IV criteria for CDD indicate apparently normal development for the first 2 years after birth the criteria for CDD also indicate a diagnosis can only be made if symptoms are not better accounted for by another pervasive developmental disorder such as autism Symptoms of CDD that separate it from autism include loss of acquired skills in areas such as motor skills and bowel or bladder control while the focus of the current study is on regression in core symptoms of autism i.e socio-communicative skills Thus the current protocol will include children with regression over 2 who meet criteria for autism but not those who only meet criteria for CDD

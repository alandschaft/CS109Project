The inclusion criteria do not quantify the initial severity or frequency of infantile spasms Infantile spasms is a unique epileptic disorder characterized by clusters of brief infantile spasms where each one lasts a few seconds and cluster may last minutes The diagnosis of infantile spasms and response to medication depends on the presence or absence of these events and the frequency of infantile spasms has not been used to determine medication efficacy in previous studies A seizure diary will be used to quantify the seizure burden however efficacy will depend on complete resolution of clinical spasms and resolution of hypsarrhythmia on EEG
